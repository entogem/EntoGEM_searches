# EntoGEM search development, testing, and pre-screening

This repository is for scripts and data associated with developing the EntoGEM searches, testing their comprehensiveness, and pre-screening titles and abstracts that are either likely to be highly relevant (as priorities for community screening), or likely to be irrelevant (moved to low-priority and/or title screening).

We will upload citations and reasons for exclusion for articles removed by pre-screening titles. Articles that are identified as likely to be relevant can be found at the [SysRev project](https://sysrev.com/u/371/p/16612) page. Articles that have not been pre-screened as high or low priority will be stored locally until we come up with additional pre-screening terms or do topic modeling on them.  

Note that the full search results are not uploaded because it probably constitutes some violation of institutional database access agreements with bibliographic databases; full search results are stored locally. Contact eliza.grames@uconn.edu with questions.
