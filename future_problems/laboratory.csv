Solms-Laub.) (Pontederiaceae) in South Africa A mirid, Eccritotarsus catarinensis (Carvalho), was studied as a potentially damaging natural enemy for water hyacinth, (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms-Laub.), in South Africa. In the laboratory, eggs were inserted into the leaf tissue parallel to the leaf surface. The four nymphal instars fed gregariously with the adults mainly on the undersurface of the leaves, causing severe chlorosis at high population levels. The duration of immature stages (egg and nymphs) was approximately 23 days, while the adults survived for approximately 50 days. Favorable biological characteristics of E. catarinensis included a high rate of increase, gregarious habits, long-lived and mobile adults, and several generations per year. Laboratory host range of the mirid was determined by adult choice trials on 67 plant species in 36 families and adult no-choice trials on five species in the Pontederiaceae. Feeding was recorded on all Pontederiaceae tested and oviposition on four of the five species. However, these plant species proved to be inferior hosts for E. catarinensis in comparison to water hyacinth, suggesting that E. catarinensis would be an acceptable natural enemy for water hyacinth in South Africa.","Life history and laboratory host range of Eccritotarsus catarinensis Carvalho Heteroptera Miridae a new natural enemy released on water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes Mart Solms-Laub Pontederiaceae in South Africa","A mirid, Eccritotarsus catarinensis (Carvalho), was studied as a potentially damaging natural enemy for water hyacinth, (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.)

We used field data from (i) an extensive survey of Argentine lakes, (ii) a 1.5 yr, monthly sampling of Salto Grande Reservoir (Argentina), and (iii) a 3-month, outdoor experiment in fish culture tanks. In addition, we performed a series of laboratory experiments aimed at isolating the effects of different variables. The increase in crustacean biomass and the amelioration of their nutritional status (measured as the reciprocal of the starvation time) caused spine enlargement. In contrast, the presence of decomposers caused reduction of the spines. These results support the idea that a major proportion of the phenotypic expression of K. tropica depends on the concentration of an inducing factor, which in turn depends on the balance between release and decomposition rates of the chemical. Food concentration was identified as a secondary factor affecting morphology. In agreement with records for other rotifiers, food concentration and spine length were inversely related. Both factors, crustacean chemicals and food availability, seemed to act independently, at different developmental stages. Our experiments suggest, however, that the most exuberant individuals can only be induced through chemicals released by predators and competitors. The presence of backswimmers (Notonectidae) resulted in individuals with very short or non-existing posterior spines. Filtrates of backswimmer-conditioned medium also produced a significant, although less striking, spine inhibition. Thus, different chemical factors seem to have opposite effects on K. tropica morphology. Those released by crustaceans induce spine elongation, while those released by backswimmers inhibit spine development. Genetic differences were also identified as a source of morphological variability. Under identical laboratory conditions, different clones had spines of different length. Our experiments also suggest an inverse relationship between spine length and growth rate. The latter result, however, is based upon only three clones of K. tropica and is thus preliminary.","Induction and inhibition of spine development in the rotifer Keratella tropica Evidence from field observations and laboratory experiments","We analysed the effect of several variables on the morphology of the rotifer Keratella tropica with the aim of accounting for its morphological variability in nature.

FIELD AND LABORATORY STUDIES OF TEMPERATURE EFFECTS ON CALLING SONG PRODUCTION AND RECOGNITION IN GRYLLUS-FIRMUS Temperature effects on calling song production and recognition were investigated in the North American field cricket, Gryllus firmus. Temporal parameters of field-recorded G. firmus calling song are strongly affected by temperature. Chirp rate and syllable rate increase, by factors of 4 and 2, respectively, as linear functions of temperature over the range in which these animals sing in the field (12.degree. - 30.degree. C). Temperature affects syllable duration to a lesser extent, and does not influence calling song carrier frequency. Female phonotactic preference, measured on a spherical treadmill in the laboratory, also changes with temperature such that warmer females prefer songs with faster chirp and syllable rates. Best phonotaxis, measured as accuracy of orientation to the sound source, and highest walking velocity, occur in response to temperature-matched songs at 15.degree., 21.degree. and 30.degree. C. Experiments under semi-natural conditions in an outdoor arena revealed that females perform phonotaxis at temperatures as low as 13.degree. C. Taken together, the song and phonotaxis data demonstrate that this communication system is temperature coupled.

Chirp rate and syllable rate increase, by factors of 4 and 2, respectively, as linear functions of temperature over the range in which these animals sing in the field (12.degree. - 30.degree. C). Temperature affects syllable duration to a lesser extent, and does not influence calling song carrier frequency. Female phonotactic preference, measured on a spherical treadmill in the laboratory, also changes with temperature such that warmer females prefer songs with faster chirp and syllable rates. Best phonotaxis, measured as accuracy of orientation to the sound source, and highest walking velocity, occur in response to temperature-matched songs at 15.degree., 21.degree. and 30.degree. C. Experiments under semi-natural conditions in an outdoor arena revealed that females perform phonotaxis at temperatures as low as 13.degree. C. Taken together, the song and phonotaxis data demonstrate that this communication system is temperature coupled. A strategy is outlined by which temperatue coupling may be exploited to test hypotheses about the organization of neural networks subserving song recognition.","NEURAL NETWORK PHONOTAXIS CHIRP RATE SYLLABLE RATE",NA,"Article","PIRES A; HOY R R","PIRES A; SECTION NEUROBIOLOGY BEHAVIOR, SG MUDD HALL, CORNELL UNIVERSITY, ITHACA, NEW YORK 14853, USA","Journal of Comparative Physiology A Sensory Neural and Behavioral Physiology","1992","171","1","69","78","10.1007/BF00195962","English","WoS_BIOSIS_CitIndex"

O. furcifer showed preferences in 40 of 45 tests, its most preferred being Sterile 4 and least preferred the two Trichoderma species. H. denticulata showed preferences in 26 tests. While Sterile 4 was also its most preferred fungus, it appeared to be less discriminating than O. furcifer. Although I. thermophila showed preferences in 26 tests, low numbers were recorded feeding. The population growth of O. furcifer and H. denticulata was monitored on 3 of the fungi; Sterile 4, the most preferred fungus of both species, O. griseum, which was highly preferred by O. furcifer but less so by H. denticulata and T. viride which was preferred by H. denticulata but numbers when fed on T. viride, whereas O. griseum appeared to be least conductive to growth. However, food type had no effect on population growth of H. denticulata and further work was confined to O. furcifer. Survivorship of O. furcifer was greater in animals fed on T. viride, and Sterile 4 than in those fed on O. griseum. The net reproductive rates (Ro) were 52.2 for T. viride, 47 for Sterile 4 cultures and 37.4 for O. griseum cultures. Generation time was shortest in T. viride cultures at 6.02 weeks and longest in O. griseum cultures at 7.4 weeks. In the Sterile 4 cultures, the generation time was 7.2 weeks. The finite population growth rates .lambda. were 1.93 for T. viride, 1.7 for Sterile 4 and 1.63 for O. griseum cultures. The age-specific reproductive values (vx) reached a peak on week 7 in both T. viride and O. griseum cultures, but reached a maximum much later in Sterile 4 cultures, on week 36.

O. furcifer showed preferences in 40 of 45 tests, its most preferred being Sterile 4 and least preferred the two Trichoderma species. H. denticulata showed preferences in 26 tests. While Sterile 4 was also its most preferred fungus, it appeared to be less discriminating than O. furcifer. Although I. thermophila showed preferences in 26 tests, low numbers were recorded feeding. The population growth of O. furcifer and H. denticulata was monitored on 3 of the fungi; Sterile 4, the most preferred fungus of both species, O. griseum, which was highly preferred by O. furcifer but less so by H. denticulata and T. viride which was preferred by H. denticulata but numbers when fed on T. viride, whereas O. griseum appeared to be least conductive to growth. However, food type had no effect on population growth of H. denticulata and further work was confined to O. furcifer. Survivorship of O. furcifer was greater in animals fed on T. viride, and Sterile 4 than in those fed on O. griseum. The net reproductive rates (Ro) were 52.2 for T. viride, 47 for Sterile 4 cultures and 37.4 for O. griseum cultures. Generation time was shortest in T. viride cultures at 6.02 weeks and longest in O. griseum cultures at 7.4 weeks. In the Sterile 4 cultures, the generation time was 7.2 weeks. The finite population growth rates .lambda. were 1.93 for T. viride, 1.7 for Sterile 4 and 1.63 for O. griseum cultures. The age-specific reproductive values (vx) reached a peak on week 7 in both T. viride and O. griseum cultures, but reached a maximum much later in Sterile 4 cultures, on week 36. An estimate was made of how age-specific fertility and survival probabilities influence the population growth .lambda., this showed that animals feeding on T. viride had a strong fertility advantage over animals feeding on either of the other two species. Fitting the VON BERTALANFFY growth equation to length data showed that the maximum theoretical length reached by O. furcifer was similar in T. viride and O. griseum cultures at 1.3 mm, while in Sterile 4 cultures it was 1.14 mm. However, growth rate was fastest in Sterile 4 cultures. Sex ratios were similar in all 3 cultures with approximately 60% female to 40% male.","ONYCHIURUS-FURCIFER HYPOGASTRURA-DENTICULATA ISOTOMINA-THERMOPHILA TRICHODERMA-VIRIDE TRICHODERMA-POLYSPORUM OIDIODENDRON-GRISEUM OIDIODENDRON-MAIUS PENICILLIUM-SP CLADOSPORIUM-SP GEOTRICHUM-SP SOIL FUNGI MALT AGAR POPULATION DYNAMICS",NA,"Article","WALSH M I; BOLGER T","WALSH M I; DEP ZOOL, UNIV COLL DUBLIN, BELFIELD, DUBLIN 4, IRELAND","Pedobiologia","1990","34","3","161","171","","English","WoS_BIOSIS_CitIndex"

The model was able to account for about 80% of the variation in aphid numbers within and between trees over a three month period. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the number of pine aphids is limited primarily by nymphal emigration, the operation of which is sensitive both to density and to plant quality as reflected in aphid growth rates. Of secondary importance are changes in reproduction acting through increased reproductive delay, again a result of altered growth rates and adult size. Development, too has an important secondary influence. Contrary to expectation and conventional belief, however, alate production proved to be of negligible importance, either in limiting or regulating population numbers.

Flies were presented with simple black shapes of 225 cm2 against a white background. Preference ran in the order: circle < square < triangle (whether the targets were black shapes on white or white on black). However, the triangle on its side (i.e. rotated through 90.degree.) or the square presented as a diamond (i.e. rotated 45.degree.) were both greatly preferred over their original orientations, whereas inverting the triangle (by rotating it 180.degree.) greatly decreased its attractiveness. There preferences were retained whether the targets were compared paired or singly. The most obvious correlation was between preference and the relative lack of horizontal features in the target. When the diamond (the most attractive target) was split horizontally by a narrow white band, its attractiveness was reduced by ca 60%, whereas when split by a vertical band the attractiveness was reduced by only ca 25%. Similarly, when an additional narrow black bar was placed horizontally beneath the diamond its attractiveness was cut by 47%, whereas when the bar was placed vertically beside it the attractiveness was cut by only 28%. These reductions occurred even though the targets should have been more attractive because of their greater edge length and area. When the effect was tested with a series of rectangles, the greater the ratio of the vertical:horizontal edge length, the greater the attractiveness. The relative inhibition of landing by the presence of horizontal features in a laboratory-tested landing site thus seems clear, notwithstanding that horizontal resting sites in nature are the most preferred.","LANDING SITE PREFERENCES OF GLOSSINA-MORSITANS-MORSITANS WESTWOOD DIPTERA GLOSSINIDAE IN THE LABORATORY AVOIDANCE OF HORIZONTAL FEATURES","Landing site preferences of fed males of Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood were measured in ca 50-cm-wide arenas in the laboratory.

Thereafter, egg production rose sharply. However, by generation 19 in one culture and 13 in another it still fell short of that of long-established colonies, in which almost all females laid under the same conditions. Oviposition by flies housed initially at a low density of 80-90 flies per cage and then transferred to a higher density, or vice versa, was measured. In some experiments these flies were given the usual single oviposition site while others were given several sites. Results indicated that the low egg production in early generations was largely due to an inhibitory effect on oviposition behavior of the large number of females at the oviposition site. No such effect was detected with flies from long established colonies. A separate culture was maintained at the lower density of 80-90 flies per cage. In each of 7 generations between generation 7 and 15, adults from this culture were kept under the higher density conditions. Their egg production was markedly less than that, in the corresponding generations, of flies from the culture in which adults had been kept under the high density conditions in every generation. Thus, the process leading to laboratory adaptation was specific to the particular culturing conditions. Maximum egg production in early generations was achieved when flies were kept at low density with a number of oviposition sites available. It is recommended that this culturing regime be used when it is desirable to minimize the rate of genetic change in laboratory cultures.","CHANGES IN REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE AUSTRALIAN SHEEP BLOWFLY LUCILIA-CUPRINA WIED DIPTERA CALLIPHORIDAE FOLLOWING LABORATORY COLONIZATION","In cages containing 400 or 600 flies (sex ratio approximately 1:1), less than 33% of females laid in each of the first 3 to 5 generations following laboratory colonization from the field.

Results indicated that the low egg production in early generations was largely due to an inhibitory effect on oviposition behavior of the large number of females at the oviposition site. No such effect was detected with flies from long established colonies. A separate culture was maintained at the lower density of 80-90 flies per cage. In each of 7 generations between generation 7 and 15, adults from this culture were kept under the higher density conditions. Their egg production was markedly less than that, in the corresponding generations, of flies from the culture in which adults had been kept under the high density conditions in every generation. Thus, the process leading to laboratory adaptation was specific to the particular culturing conditions. Maximum egg production in early generations was achieved when flies were kept at low density with a number of oviposition sites available. It is recommended that this culturing regime be used when it is desirable to minimize the rate of genetic change in laboratory cultures.","POPULATION DENSITY SEX RATIO EGG PRODUCTION OVIPOSITION GENETIC CHANGE FIELD VS.

Populations of predator and prey organisms were kept together in replicate laboratory microcosms at densities ranging from 2,500-12,500 predators/m2 and 12,500-62,500 prey/m2 for 15- to 30-day periods. Control populations of predators and prey were maintained separately for comparative purposes. A separate selection experiment showed that larvae preferred sediments containing tubificids or previously settled larvae over sediments that contained neither. Mortality in worm populations kept with predatory Coelotanypus larvae averaged 56.9% (S.D. = 3.9%) and was significantly higher (p < 0.001, t-test) than the 9.7% (S.D = 3.1%) average mortality in control populations.

The proportion of leaves damaged by lucerne flea was highest in the least cyanogenic cultivar but also tended to increase in the most cyanogenic cultivar, confirming a field observation, At high population densities lucerne flea was capable of killing some seedlings but was not tested against established plants.","SITONA-LEPIDUS DEROCERAS-RETICULATUM ARION-FASCIATUS SMINTHURUS-VIRIDIS CYANOGENIC PLANTS",NA,"Article","MOWAT D J; SHAKEEL M A","MOWAT D J; AGRIC ZOOL RES DIV, DEP AGRIC NORTH IREL, NEWFORAGE LANE, BELFAST BT9 5PX, UK","Grass and Forage Science","1988","43","4","405","410","10.1111/j.1365-2494.1988.tb01896.x","English","WoS_BIOSIS_CitIndex"

Each island was founded by one pair of adults such that F1 offspring were all heterozygotes at a marker locus.

Replicate archipelagos (founded by identical combinations of males and females on each island) were similar in response: diversity among archipelagos was rarely larger than 1%. Diversity among islands within archipelagos rapidly increased in IHC and IHV and reached about 60% of total diversity in about five generations. When, at this point, OV archipelagos branched off from IHC by imposed interisland migration, diversity among islands rapidly decreased to about half its previous value.

A characteristic pattern emerged for subterranean termite species. At low population densities (< 0.01 g termites/ml), performance improved with an increase in group size; at higher densities, it tended to decline. The impact of altering group size and container volume on termite vigor was most pronounced at low population densities; at higher population densities, performance tended to be more stable but declined markedly when termites became overcrowded. In most jar-type experiments on termites, especially those conducted in Europe and the USA, small groups of termites are housed in disproportionately large jars, resulting in very low, suboptimal population densities.

Offered a choice of these 2 zooplankton species, Notonecta selects Daphnia or large individuals of either species. To test whether this preference affects prey species and size-classes differently, population were measured when the predator and one prey species or the other were placed together in plastic tubs for 7-8 wk. Roughly half of the replicated laboratory populations of Daphnia pulex that were exposed to predation by a constant number and age-class of Notonecta were driven extinct within 8 wk. The remainder of these populations maintained densities similar to those of control populations without predators. Populations surviving at each sampling period partially compensated for mortality caused by predators by small increases in individual fecundity, which maintained their population birth rates at the same level as those of control populations. Fecundity was inversely related to the density of adult Daphnia and to the total biomass of Daphnia. In populations exposed to predation, the other compensatory mechanism was a decrease in the mortality of young from factors (probably starvation) other than predation. Predation reduced the average size of individuals in Daphnia populations and consequently markedly reduced the average biomass. This presumably increased the food per capita available to juveniles and small adults in predation treatments over the level available to their counterparts in controls, and hence both reduced mortality from starvation and increased size-related fecundity. Populations exposed to predation appeared to have stable dynamics for varying periods. However, as the experiment progressed, apparently random events in some populations caused the predation rate to exceed Daphnia's ability to compensate, and in each successive intersampling period a few populations were driven extinct. Extinction was probabilistic. Thus both a deterministic and a stochastic framework are required to explain the dynamics of these laboratory populations.

Recently fed virgins and females in early and mid-pregnancy were least active. In late pregnancy, activity increased and more walking occurred. In all classes of females, activity was least around midday, but the V-shaped curve became less pronounced as parturition approached. There was evidence of a slight preference for black over white surfaces when landing but a clear preference for black resting sites. Virgin females preferred to alight and rest on vertical surfaces at the borders of areas of visual contrast; pregnant females preferred to alight and rest on horizontal surfaces and showed no attraction to regions of contrast.

Recently fed virgins and females in early and mid-pregnancy were least active. In late pregnancy, activity increased and more walking occurred. In all classes of females, activity was least around midday, but the V-shaped curve became less pronounced as parturition approached. There was evidence of a slight preference for black over white surfaces when landing but a clear preference for black resting sites. Virgin females preferred to alight and rest on vertical surfaces at the borders of areas of visual contrast; pregnant females preferred to alight and rest on horizontal surfaces and showed no attraction to regions of contrast.

The processes were investigated by single generation experiments. Competition in the adult stage resulted in lower per capita fecundity and increased egg mortality.

Competition in the larval stages was of the contest type in both species. The number of survivors reaches a plateau as the number of larval recruits increases, where the number of survivors was highest for C. chinensis than for C. maculatus. Analytical models for density dependence are used to describe the outcomes of competition in the larval and adult stages.

Best results were obtained when aphids were extracted in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and the extracts incubated at 37.degree. C for 1 h before starting the assay. Using batches of 20 green peach aphids (Myzus persicae), about 0.01 ng PLRV/aphid was detected. The virus could also be detected in single aphids allowed a 1-day acquisition access period on infected potato leaves. The PLRV content of aphids depended on the age of potato source-plants and the position of the source leaves on them. It increased with increase in acquisition access period up to 7 days but differed between individual aphids. A maximum of 7 ng PLRV/aphid was recorded but aphids more usually accumulated about 0.2 ng PLRV/day. When aphids were allowed acquisition access periods of 1-3 days and then caged singly on Physalis floridana seedlings for 3 days, the PLRV content of each aphid, measured subsequently, was not strongly correlated with the infection of P. floridana. The concentration of PLRV in leaf extracts differed only slightly when potato plants were kept at 15, 20, 25 or 30.degree. C for 1 or 2 wk, but the virus content of aphids kept on leaves at the different temperatures decreased with increase of temperature. PLRV was transmitted readily to P. floridana at all temperatures, but by a slightly smaller proportion of aphids and after a longer latent period, at 15.degree. C than at 30.degree. C. The PLRV content of M. persicae fed on infected potato leaves decreased with increasing time after transfer to turnip (immune to PLRV). The decrease occurred in 2 phases, the 1st rapid and the 2nd very slow. In the 1st phase the decrease was faster, briefer and greater at 25 and 30.degree. C than at 15 and 20.degree. C. No evidence was obtained that PLRV multiplies in M. persicae. These results are compatible with a model in which much of the PLRV in aphids during the 2nd phase is in the hemocoele and transmission is mainly limited by the rate of passage of virus particles from hemolymph to saliva. The potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, transmitted PLRV much less efficiently than M. persicae. Its inefficiency as a vector could not be ascribed to failure to acquire or retain PLRV, or to the degradation of virus particles in the aphid. Probably only few PLRV particles pass from the hemolymph to saliva in this species. The virus content of M. euphorbiae collected from PLRV-infected potato plants in the field increased from early June to early July, and then decreased. PLRV was detected both in spring migrants collected from the plants and in summer migrants caught in yellow water-traps. PLRV was also detected in M. persicae collected from infected plants in July and Aug., and in trapped summer migrants, but their PLRV content was less than that of M. euphorbiae, and in some instances was too small for detection.","QUANTITATIVE STUDIES ON THE UPTAKE AND RETENTION OF POTATO LEAF-ROLL VIRUS BY APHIDS IN LABORATORY AND FIELD CONDITIONS","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was adapted for the efficient detection and assay of potato leafroll virus (PLRV) in aphids.

More recently, the focus of this argument has turned increasingly towards the statistical properties of population fluctuations, with many studies showing that ecological systems tend to be dominated by low-frequency or long-term dynamics, termed 'red' noise. Currently, the source of the 'redness' in ecological time-series is hotly debated, with the general consensus being that environmental variables are the major driving force. Here we show that three classic laboratory populations known to display irregular fluctuations also have reddened spectra. Furthermore, the dynamics of these populations show very well-defined generic scaling properties in the form of power laws.

Individuals reared in batches of 30 larvae had significantly shorter larval periods and total developmental times than those reared in batches of 60, 90 or 120.

When reared on artificial diet, the larval stage lasted 18.4 days, the pupal stage 10.2 days, and total development time (one-day-old larvae to adult) 28.7 days. On average, pupae of males weighed 80.7 mg and those of females 111.2 mg; adult males weighed 44.0 mg and females 65.2 mg. Mated females laid an average of 268 eggs, while unmated ones laid 155. Females had a longer mean life span (6.1 days) than males (5.3 days). Individuals reared in batches of 30 larvae had significantly shorter larval periods and total developmental times than those reared in batches of 60, 90 or 120. Pupal and adult weights decreased significantly as the population size increased.

When there were more females than males, each male mated more often than when the ratio was 1:1. Conversely, when there were more males than females, females mated more often than when the ratio was 1:1. Most females (75%-92%) emerged and mated the same evening (day 1). If the female received a large spermatophore, sexual activity terminated for 42%-63% of the females, depending on sex ratio; but 37% of the females mated again on the 2nd-7th day. A significant increase in mating occurred on the 6th and 7th days, near the end of the female's life span. When receptive females were available, males mated once daily for 3-5 days, depending on ratio and density. Virgin females mated at any age. Copulation of virgin moths usually lasted 40 min; subsequent matings were longer and the size of the spermatophore was reduced. Males usually needed a period in excess of 12 h after mating to produce a 2nd spermatophore. Sexual activity was density dependent; at moderate density (5-10 pair/cage), nearly all males and females were sexually active the 1st day following eclosion.","CODLING MOTH MATING BEHAVIOR IN THE LABORATORY","Mating behavior of codling moths, Laspeyresia pomonella (L.) in the laboratory was influenced by both the ratio of males to females and by the number (density) of the moths present. When there were more females than males, each male mated more often than when the ratio was 1:1. Conversely, when there were more males than females, females mated more often than when the ratio was 1:1. Most females (75%-92%) emerged and mated the same evening (day 1). If the female received a large spermatophore, sexual activity terminated for 42%-63% of the females, depending on sex ratio; but 37% of the females mated again on the 2nd-7th day. A significant increase in mating occurred on the 6th and 7th days, near the end of the female's life span. When receptive females were available, males mated once daily for 3-5 days, depending on ratio and density. Virgin females mated at any age. Copulation of virgin moths usually lasted 40 min; subsequent matings were longer and the size of the spermatophore was reduced. Males usually needed a period in excess of 12 h after mating to produce a 2nd spermatophore. Sexual activity was density dependent; at moderate density (5-10 pair/cage), nearly all males and females were sexually active the 1st day following eclosion.","LASPEYRESIA-POMONELLA SEX RATIO DENSITY SPERMATOPHORE SIZE",NA,"Article","HOWELL J F; HUTT R B; HILL W B","HOWELL J F; YAKIMA AGRIC RES LAB, FED RES, SCI EDUC ADM, YAKIMA, WASH 98902, USA","Annals of the Entomological Society of America","1978","71","6","891","896","10.1093/aesa/71.6.891","English","WoS_BIOSIS_CitIndex"

Exposure to NPV contamination could entail not only the premature death of some individuals, but more importantly, a marked debilitation of the survivors, particularly affecting the weight of adult females, the number of eggs produced and in some instances, of egg fertility. The susceptibility of larvae decreased with age at time of exposure to contamination. Females tended to suffer higher mortality than males. Effects imputable to the pathogen could be generated in 2 ways: by inoculating the food of target larvae with suspensions of the pathogen and by merely allowing cohorts of originally normal larvae to develop in areas presumed to be grossly contaminated with the virus. Typical symptoms of polyhedrosis, characteristic of outbreaks in field populations could only be caused by the former method. In the latter NPV-related mortality tended to be low, affecting very yound larvae within the first days of exposure; effects were mainly in the form of impairments in the demographic performance of surviving individuals. Some larvae showing the terminal symptoms of epizootic polyhedrosis were observed in originally normal cohorts stressed by deliberate exposure to unusually high temperature. Virus effects appeared more frequently and became more severe as breeding was carried out at successively higher temperatures within the tolerated range. The virus could influence its host in the long term by reducing demographic fitness of breeding lines after prolonged exposure in contaminated areas. This debilitation might be linked with a genetically acquired tolerance of the virus. NPV should be regarded as an intrinsic component of the life system, capable of actually modifying the characteristic properties of the host species.","THE LIGHT-BROWN APPLE MOTH EPIPHYAS-POSTVITTANA PART 1 EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTAMINATIONS BY A NUCLEAR POLYHEDROSIS VIRUS ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC PERFORMANCE OF A LABORATORY STRAIN","The possible effects of a nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV), apparently widespread throughout the Australian distribution of E. postvittana, were investigated in a laboratory strain of the moth.

These clones were fed 4 different food concentrations (1.6, 4.9, 16.4, and 49.2 [mu]g/ml) of 3 different algal species (Chlamydomonas rein-hardti, Euglena gracilis, and E. geniculata). Rates of increase, birth, death, survivorship, net reproduction, and generation time were measured for all combinations of these variables. Growth rates of individual animals depend on food concentration and not age or food species. Although population growth rates in mass culture are related to both food species and food concentration, the ultimate density of the population depends only on food concentration. Individuals of the young orthoclone have higher rates of population increase than those of the old orthoclone. When Euchlanis feeds upon Chlamydomonas the rates of increase are higher than when Euglena gracilis serves as food. E. gracilis, in turn, leads to higher rates than E. geniculata. The rate of population increase is directly related to the density of food for concentrations up to 16.4 [mu]g/ml, but a further increase in food concentration does not result in a corresponding increase in the rate of population growth. These different rates of increase result more from corresponding differences in net reproduction (number of eggs laid by the average female in her lifetime) than from the schedule of egg laying or survivorship. The different rates of population growth can not be explained by differences in the rate of food intake and must result from either differences in assimilation or chemical differences in the foods themselves. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author","Food age and the dynamics of a laboratory population of rotifers","Two clones of the rotifer Euchlanis dilatata were derived from a single parent by parthenogenesis so that in succeeding generations the individuals of one clone (the young orthoclone) were always derived from young parents and those of the other (the old orthoclone) from old parents.

The effects of both intraspecific and interspecific competition were to increase the fraction of food utilized for maintenance and reduce the fraction utilized for growth of sculpins. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors","",NA,"Article","DAVIS, GERALD E.; WARREN, CHARLES E.","Dep.

Anopheles gambiae var. melas in the Gambia and colony A. g. gambiae and Aedes aegypti in London were exposed to contact with an alkylating agent, thio-tepa, by resting on a treated surface at 18-20 mg/sq. ft. for 1-3 hours. Chemosterilization was highly effective in treated females previously mated to normal males. With wild-caught female A. g. var. melas in Gambia, 68.7% of 6369 control eggs hatched, but only 0.8% of 6913 eggs from treated females, and these few fertile eggs were probably laid too soon after exposure of the females to be affected by the treatment. With female Ae. aegypti, 86.8% of 4105 control eggs hatched, but only 2.3% of 2270 eggs from treated females. The cause of hatches in these few eggs is uncertain. Sperms from normal males of Ae. aegypti remained numerous and active in the spermathecae of treated females for 6 weeks after their exposure to thio-tepa. Nevertheless, the females laid sterile eggs, some of abnormal shape and pigmentation, for 4 gonotrophic cycles over 6 weeks; and fecundity also appeared to be declining over this period. Active sperms were still present in treated male Ae. aegypti 32 days after treatment, and insemination of the female could still take place; reduction of testes appeared to be occurring with time. Normal female Ae. aegypti mated, over 15 days, to treated males, laid almost exclusively, infertile eggs. Females mated to these males later, 18-28 days after the male treatment, produced considerably more fertile eggs. This capacity of males to begin producing fertile sperm again in a relatively short time after treatment could prejudice the success of control operations based on male chemosterilization. The cytogenetic and cytostatic mechanisms of mutagenic chemicals, as observed in Drosophila in researches of others relating to cancer therapy, are briefly discussed and some interpretation offered on this basis for the chemosterilant effects of thio-tepa on mosquitoes. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author","Observations on the chemosterilant effect of an alkylating agent thio-tepa on wild-caught Anopheles gambiae var melas Theo in Gambia West Africa and on laboratory-bred A g gambiae Giles and Aedes aegypti L","Anopheles gambiae var. melas in the Gambia and colony A. g. gambiae and Aedes aegypti in London were exposed to contact with an alkylating agent, thio-tepa, by resting on a treated surface at 18-20 mg/sq. ft. for 1-3 hours.

[English summ.] Results are given of the preliminary laboratory experiments with the Moroccan locust (Dociostaurus maroccanus) reared at different population densities. The experiments were carried out at the Laboratory of the Anti-Locust Research Centre in London, as a part of the training in locust studies on FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) scholarship. Eggpods were obtained from oviposition sites in Cyprus. The eggs were in XIII and XIV stage of diapause i. e. towards the end of anatrepsis. They were induced to hatch after being exposed to the low temperature (0[degree]C) for 65 days, and then transferred to the constant temperature room at 28.5[degree]C. The nymphs were reared at the constant temperature (28.5[degree]C) isolated in 1 1 jam jars or crowded at different degrees in 12 1 celluloid cylinders. The method for rearing locusts used by Gunn and Hunter-Jones (1952) was followed. The standard measurements proposed by the Fourth International Locust Conference at Cairo 1936 were applied. The morphometric analysis of the hoppers has shown that there were significant differences in nymphs reared at different densities both in the size and in their F/C and F/P ratios. F/P ratio varied at different rearing densities beginning from the 3d instar (1st and 2d instars were not measured). The ratio was highest in isolated nymphs (3.09) decreasing in slightly crowded (2.94) and in crowded nymphs (2.51). Its value was decreasing gradually with age of nymphs. The differences in F/C ratio did not become evident until 4th instar. The ratio was also the (did not) highest in isolated nymphs (2.80) decreasing gradually towards crowded nymphs (2.60 and 2.51). The value of F/C was increasing with age of hoppers. This opposite trend of F/C and F/P was caused by different growth rate of the pronotum and head. Parallel chromatic differences in nymphs were observed at different rearing densities. An attempt was made to follow the changes in intensity of the black pigmentation in hoppers by estimating the percentage of the lateral surface of the 4th abdominal tergite covered by the black pattern. The latter was ranging from 17-22% in isolated hoppers (average for the 3 last instars) to about 60-63% of the surface covered by the black pattern in crowded hoppers. Percentage of the black pigmentation was higher in females. There was a slight decrease of the black colour in 4th and 5th instars. Certain differences in the rate of development and mortality were recorded at different rearing densities. Both, the mean duration of the total development and the total mortality showed larger values in 2 extremes i. e. in isolated hoppers on 1 hand and in crowded ones on the other hand. Shortest nymphal development and lowest mortality were observed in slightly crowded hoppers which was in accordance with ""Allee's Principle"" (Alleeetal., 1949). The prolonged development in isolation resulted presumably from the lower individual metabolism caused by the lack of interactions between hoppers which otherwise leads to synchronization of moultings. The lack of that synchronizing effect is evident from the large standard deviation from the mean duration of instars in isolated nymphs. The mean E/F ratio of the isolated adults was 1.51 (for the 2 sexes) i.e. slightly higher than in the field solitaries (1.48). At the average density of 4 hoppers per cage the ratio was 1.64, while at the density of 20 individuals per cage it reached 1.75. Nevertheless, E/F ratio of the crowded adults was only 1.71 i.e. a little lower than at the preceding density. According to Gunn and Hunter-Jones (1952) Locusta hoppers reared in drier air and in ventilated cage show higher E/F ratio when adults. Presumably this could be one of the reasons for the higher E/F ratio in slightly crowded adults of the Moroccan Locust for one could expect the air humidity to be lower in cages which are not heavily crowded. Anyway E/F ratio in both slightly crowded and heavily crowded adults was lower than in the field gregaria. F/C ratio of adults was also different at different rearing densities. In isolated adults the ratio was 3.16 (mean for the 2 sexes), at the average density of 4 adults/cage it showed 2.92. With further augmentation of rearing density F/C ratio did not show significant differences, with exception of the crowded females where its value dropped further to 2.82. The experiments have shown that in the Moroccan locust, like in other locusts, the changes similar to the phase changes occurring in its natural populations can be induced by mean of crowding or isolating the hoppers during their development under laboratory conditions. Nevertheless to induce extreme phase characters in locusts more than one generation reared under mentioned conditions is needed. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author","Some laboratory experiments on phases in the Moroccan locust Dociostaurus maroccanus Thunb English summ","Results are given of the preliminary laboratory experiments with the Moroccan locust (Dociostaurus maroccanus) reared at different population densities.

The mean ratio value of head capsule widths in the M. brassicae larval instars was about 1.586 and was correlated with temperature and age.

An experimental laboratory study on the sexual behavior of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) Exptl. evidence is presented to confirm Johnston's and Mayer's hypothesis that in Culicidae Johnston's organ is aural in function, an assumption previously based chiefly on morph. evidence. Expts. also proved that the males perceive vibratory stimuli as had been hypothesized in the literature. The front and middle tarsi of the male are structurally suited for seizing and holding the female. The hind tarsi take little part in mating. The female tarsi are not suited for seizing and she does not cling to the male or hold him to her during copulation. Knab's hypothesis that the positions assumed by mosquitoes during cop-ulation are correlated with the female tarsal claws is unfounded. The hypothesis is suggested that the face-to-face and end-to-end positions assumed by different spp. of mosquitoes during copulation might be correlated with the degree of development of the last tarsal segments and claws of the male's front and middle legs. The sound produced by the female of A. aegypti in flight is the external stimulus which attracts and induces the male to copulate. Odor and sounds other than those made by the female in flight play no role in the mating behavior. The male attempts to copulate when a sufficient number of antennal fibrillae are ex-tended making possible the perception of the sound of the flying female. This occurs about 15 to 24 hrs. after emergence and by this time the hypopygium has rotated sufficiently so that copulation can be successfully completed. Copulation occurs only when the female begins to fly voluntarily at least several hrs. after emergence. By this time she becomes ""attractive"" because the sound she makes in flight falls within the range which will stimulate the male. Sexually active males cannot differentiate between recently emerged males and old females. The male responds to a range of sound frequencies rather than to a single fixed frequency; thus aegypti males attempt to copulate with males and females of several different spp. of Culicidae because the sounds made by these mosquitoes fall within a stimulating range. The instinctive mating behavior of aegypti males whether elicited by a female mosquito or by mechanically produced sounds, as by tuning fork, is basically the same. The seizing response elicited by the sounds of tuning forks or an audio oscillator-speaker consists of clinging with the front and middle legs to the cloth of the cage, and vibrating the wings rapidly. The clasping response usually follows the seizing response and consists of flexing the abdomen ventrad. The upper and lower limits of sound frequencies which will induce a mating response from aegypti males are about 100 and 800 cycles per sec. The limits vary with the age and virginity or non-virginity of the males. With increase in age both virgin and non-virgin males respond to a wider range of sound but the range of non. virgins which have copulated repeatedly is narrower than that of virgin males kept isolated from females. The practical application of the response of mosquitoes to sound is discussed and it is concluded that, at present, it appears unlikely that a killing device employing sound as an attractant would be a more efficient or economical substitute than the present methods of mosquito control. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: L.

The larvae of 3rd and 4th instar appear to be the most injurious. Rice plants are most vulnerable in the stage included from seedling to rooting. The most frequent damage is represented by the destruction of the root apparatus. In the laboratory trials a population density of 10 larvae/dm2 may cause an 80% loss of plants. Although the loss of seeds is important, in the field trials the damage was seen to be much lower in comparison to the laboratory trials.","Laboratory trials evaluating the damage caused by Cricotopus sylvestris F and Chironomus pallidivittatus Mall Diptera Chironomidae living in the rice fields in the Verona plain","From 1988 till 1993 laboratory and field trials were carried out on the damage caused by the larvae of two species of Dipteran Chironomids, Cricotopus sylvestris (F.) and Chironomus pallidivittatus (Mall.), very frequently found in the rice fields of the Verona province.

Conidia of GHA 92 and GHA 94 exhibited good germination ( gt 92%) by 24 h, but the rate of germination was slower for GHA 94 than for GHA 92. Although both conidial batches were highly virulent (LD-50 lt 6 times 10-3 conidia per nymph) against nymphs of Melanoplus sanguinipes (Fabricius) (Orthoptera: Acrididae) in the laboratory, GHA 92 was slightly more virulent than GHA 94. Conidia were applied to field populations of grasshoppers in a 1.5% emulsifiable oil-emulsion amended with 4% clay at a volume of 112 L/ha. There were no differences between GHA 92 and GHA 94 in the deposition of spray droplets on water-sensitive papers or of conidia on leaves and coverslips (2.4 times 10-4 to 4.1 times 10-4 cfu/cm-2). All grasshopper nymphs collected from plots sprayed with conidia of GHA 92 and GHA 94 were equally infested with B. bassiana; conidial populations averaged 3.5 times 10-3 to 4.3 times 10-3 cfu/nymph. Conditions were hot, dry, and sunny, and regardless of the batch, persistence of conidia was equally short on both leaves and grasshoppers. Neither treatment of B. bassiana significantly reduced field populations nor did either impact differentially on specific grasshopper taxa. However, among grasshoppers collected immediately after conidial application and maintained in cages in the greenhouse, over 80% died of infection with B. bassiana. For both conidial treatments, the prevalence of disease in caged grasshoppers decreased with the sampling date but the onset of mycosis always occurred 3-4 days after collection. This study indicates that environmental conditions in the field and not pathogen virulence or targeting were responsible for the poor efficacy of B. bassiana against grasshoppers.","Field and laboratory evaluation of two conidial batches of Beauveria bassiana Balsamo Vuillemin against grasshoppers","The efficacy of two production batches of conidia of Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin that showed differential field efficacy in 1992 (GHA 92) and 1994 (GHA 94) were compared against grasshoppers in the laboratory and field.

Larvae were reared on artificial diet containing GNA at 2% (w/w) dietary protein; on excised leaves of transgenic potato expressing GNA at approx. 0.07% of total soluble proteins; and on transgenic potato plants expressing GNA at approx. 0.6% of total soluble proteins in glasshouse trials. Significant effects on larval growth were observed with all three treatments. At 21 days after hatch mean larval biomass was reduced by 32 and 23%, in the artificial diet and excised leaf bioassays respectively. In glasshouse trials a 48% reduction in insect biomass per plant was observed after 35 days. The artificial diet and excised leaf assays also showed that GNA significantly slowed larval development as assessed by instar duration. GNA caused a 59% overall reduction in mean daily consumption in the artificial diet assay, and a significant reduction in leaf damage in glasshouse trials. However, prolonged compensatory feeding by larvae in the excised leaf assay resulted in their consuming 15% more total leaf material than the control group. Adaptation to low levels of GNA, in terms of biomass recovery and compensatory feeding, was observed within one larval generation in the detached leaf assay. No significant effects of GNA on larval survival were observed in the artificial diet and detached leaf bioassays, whereas survival was decreased by approx. 40% in the glasshouse bioassay. The assays show that the insecticidal effects of GNA can be observed both in vitro when fed in artificial diet and in planta, and can be demonstrated in the glasshouse as well as under growth cabinet conditions.","Effects of snowdrop lectin GNA delivered via artificial diet and transgenic plants on the development of tomato moth Lacanobia oleracea larvae in laboratory and glasshouse trials","The effects of snowdrop lectin (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, GNA) on Lacanobia oleracea larval growth, development, consumption, and survival, were examined by 3 distinct bioassay methods.

Litter and soil plots (c. 4.5 m-2 each) were sprayed with an aqueous suspension concentrate formulation of tebufenozide at rates of 35, 70 and 140 g AI ha-1. Samples were collected at intervals up to 408 days after spraying, and analyzed for tebufenozide residues. The data were subjected to regression analysis and half-life (DT-50, the time required for 50% of the initial residues to disappear) values were computed. The DT-50 was c. 62 days for both substrates treated with the two lower dosage rates. At the highest dosage rate, the DT-50 was 115 days for the litter and c. 52 days for the soil, indicating irregular variations in persistence. Downward movement in soil occurred only in trace amounts, suggesting strong adsorption. Laboratory microcosm studies were conducted to investigate the relative importance of rainfall, exposure to light and volatilization on persistence. Vertical movement occurred in litter and soil (both sandy and clay types) during rainfall. The amount moved increased with the amount of rainfall, but decreased with the rain-free period. The larger the rain droplets, the greater the downward movement. When the rainwater could move laterally along the surface of the substrate (as would occur on a slope), more lateral movement than vertical movement of tebufenozide occurred. The photolysis study indicated that disappearance of tebufenozide was directly related to the duration of exposure to radiation and radiation intensity. Volatilization of tebufenozide depended upon the ambient temperature and the duration of air passing through the substrates. Nonetheless, the amount lost by volatilization was much lower than the amount lost after rainfall or exposure to radiation, thus indicating the greater influence of rainfall and sunlight on persistence. In the laboratory microcosm studies, more tebufenozide was lost from the sandy substrates than from the clay substrates. This behaviour was attributed to the greater adsorptive capacity of the clay substrates, thus providing a greater protection against downward mobility and loss due to radiation.","Persistence and mobility of tebufenozide in forest litter and soil ecosystems under field and laboratory conditions","A field microcosm study was conducted to determine persistence of tebufenozide, an insect growth regulator, in sandy litter and soil.

"19764",19764,"BCI:BCI199799325262","Exogenous jasmonates simulate insect wounding in tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum) in the laboratory and field Wounding increases the levels and activities of several defense-related proteins in the foliage of the tomato plant, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. Evidence indicates that two of these responses, the systemic increases in polyphenol oxidase and proteinase inhibitors, are regulated by an octadecanoid-based signalling pathway which includes the wound hormone, jasmonic acid. It is not known whether other responses to wounding are also regulated by this same signalling pathway. In this paper, we show that application of jasmonates (jasmonic acid or its volatile derivative, methyl jasmonate) in low concentrations to foliage of young tomato plants induced, in a dose-dependent manner, the same protein responses-polyphenol oxidase, proteinase inhibitors, lipoxygenase, and peroxidase-as does Helicoverpa zea Boddie feeding. Application of jasmonic acid to a single leaflet of four-leaf tomato plants induced these four proteins in a spatial pattern nearly identical to that produced by localized feeding of H. zea. Exogenous jasmonic acid also decreased suitability of foliage for the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua Hubner in the laboratory. Based on these results, we conducted an experiment to measure the effects of jasmonic acid spray under field conditions. We provide the first evidence that jasmonic acid spray on field plants induces production of chemical defenses above the levels found in unsprayed controls. Exogenous jasmonic acid sprayed on plants in agricultural plots increased levels of polyphenol oxidase and proteinase inhibitors. Because application of jasmonic acid induces these defensive compounds at low concentrations in a manner similar to natural wounding, it may prove to be a useful tool for stimulating plant resistance to insects in the field.","Exogenous jasmonates simulate insect wounding in tomato plants Lycopersicon esculentum in the laboratory and field","Wounding increases the levels and activities of several defense-related proteins in the foliage of the tomato plant, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. Evidence indicates that two of these responses, the systemic increases in polyphenol oxidase and proteinase inhibitors, are regulated by an octadecanoid-based signalling pathway which includes the wound hormone, jasmonic acid. It is not known whether other responses to wounding are also regulated by this same signalling pathway. In this paper, we show that application of jasmonates (jasmonic acid or its volatile derivative, methyl jasmonate) in low concentrations to foliage of young tomato plants induced, in a dose-dependent manner, the same protein responses-polyphenol oxidase, proteinase inhibitors, lipoxygenase, and peroxidase-as does Helicoverpa zea Boddie feeding. Application of jasmonic acid to a single leaflet of four-leaf tomato plants induced these four proteins in a spatial pattern nearly identical to that produced by localized feeding of H. zea. Exogenous jasmonic acid also decreased suitability of foliage for the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua Hubner in the laboratory. Based on these results, we conducted an experiment to measure the effects of jasmonic acid spray under field conditions.

At 20-35 degree C, the duration of larval and pupal stage decreased as the temperature increased. Within a moderate temperature range (25-30 degree C), an An. sinensis larva needed 8-11 d to pupate. In a rearing tray, the most appropriate density for an An. sinensis to grow was 200 larvae/450 ml water; in other words, 1 cm-2 of the rearing tray bottom held 0.25 larvae of An. sinensis. When a larva was reared in a less dense tray, its pupal weight was heavier and the adult's wing longer. Male An. sinensis would swarm and mate if over 15 pairs were present under 1 lux of light after a dark period. The highest insemination rate appeared when 240 pairs were put together. If the cage space for them to swarm was smaller than 15 times 20 times 25 cm-3, then mating would usually fail. It was easiest to manipulate their mating in a 35 times 35 times 35 cm-3 cage. An adult started to mate on the 2nd day after emergence, and the insemination rate reached the peak on the 5th day. An inseminated female, 2 d post blood meal, began to oviposit until the 9th day, and had the highest egg production during 2-4 d post blood meal. The time a female laid its eggs was usually between 6-9 pm. If fed with human or cow blood, it would have a fully developed ovary and produce more eggs. The gonotrophic cycle shortened and the number of egg deposited decreased as reproduction parity increased.

In the field, larval crowding is thought to be sporadic, but occasionally intense. To determine whether crowding affects host persistence, I compared the population dynamics of infected females (hosts) under crowded conditions to those expected from data collected on uncrowded females. I estimated host fitness components and maternal transmission rates for individual females under uncrowded conditions in both the artificial host D. pseudoobscura (this paper) and the native host D. willistoni (previously reported). Spiroplasma infection had no effect on lifetime production of daughters in D. pseudoobscura; however, as with some D. willistoni lines, hosts may produce more of their daughters earlier in life than nonhosts. Because individual contributions to relative rates of increase calculated from these fitness data were similar for hosts and nonhosts, I expected hosts to persist in laboratory populations. Instead, three patterns were observed: rapid extinction of D. willistoni females infected with male-lethal spiroplasmas, slow decline or persistence of hosts (depending on initial frequency) in both D. pseudoobscura infected with male-lethal spiroplasmas, and D. willistoni infected with non-male-lethal spiroplasmas. Population dynamics, then, depend on host species and bacterial isolate. Fitness estimates change with host line in uncrowded D. willistoni, but host genetic background did not affect population dynamics. These and previously published results show that the interaction phenotype changes with host and parasite isolate, and that host fitness can be affected by crowding. Crowding in natural populations may therefore decrease host fitness but, in expanding populations, early reproduction in hosts may be to their advantage. Possible effects of seasonal fluctuations in population density on the fitness of infected Drosophila are discussed.","Variable effects of crowding on Drosophila hosts of male-lethal and non-male-lethal spiroplasmas in laboratory populations","Male-lethal, maternally inherited spiroplasmas occur in four species of Drosophila, and persist in natural populations despite imperfect vertical transmission rates.

We also wanted to determine the minimum number of individuals needed to establish a vital colony. As a result, every colony beginning with less than 20 workers died within 60 weeks, while colonies beginning with at least 20 workers survived until the end of the tests, with varied survival rates dependent upon the initial size and the time of formation (summer or autumn). The number of nymphs did not affect colony survival and colony growth. Reproductives developed from nymphs within 2 weeks and later from workers. Many of the reproductives derived from nymphs were killed by workers. The majority of the colonies contained two reproductives 3 years after initiating the tests. In addition, a few individual workers were still alive at the end of the 3-year tests. At the end of the tests, the proportion of soldiers ranged anywhere from 5.23 to 7.69% of the total population. The number of viable ""juveniles"" from each colony was relatively low throughout the tests and the overall population growth was not sufficient enough to replace dead workers or increase the colony size considerably.

It attacks eggs of several lepidopterous pests, and is a major biological control agent. Rearing parasitoids is necessary for experimental work, and, potentially, for mass release in the field. Selecting a suitable host is critical for developing a successful rearing method. If other conditions are the same, the rate of population increase will be a suitable indicator of parasitoid performance on different hosts. However, conclusions based on a single generation can be misleading because of the learning ability of parasitoids. Life history parameters of T. brassicae were studied on two hosts easily reared in the laboratory, Anagasta kuehniella Zeller, and Plodia interpunctella Hubner (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). All the experiments were carried out at 24 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 10% RH, and 16:8 L:D photoperiod. Eight parameters including gross and net reproductive rates (GRR and R-0 respectively), intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), finite rate of population increase (lambda), intrinsic birth and death rates (b and d respectively), cohort generation time (T), and doubling time (DT) were compared between two hosts for two generations. All parameters showed a highly significant difference (alpha = 0.01) between hosts. GRR, R-0, r(m), lambda, and b were higher, while d, T, and DT were lower in Anagasta than Plodia. The intrinsic rate of natural increase was 0.2912 and 0.2145 female/female/day and net replacement rate was 45.51 and 19.26 female/female/generation in Anagasta and Plodia respectively. Differences between generations were significant except for r(m), lambda, and d. The net replacement rate was 28.56 and 39 in the 1(st) and 2(nd) generations respectively. These results showed that A. kuehniella was a better host than P. interpunctella. Higher reproduction occurred in the second generation that may be due to increased adaptation to experimental conditions.","Demography and life history of the egg parasitoid Trichogramma brassicae on two moths Anagasta kuehniella and Plodia interpunctella in the laboratory","The egg parasitoid, Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko ( Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) is the most important and widely distributed species of Trichogramma in Iran.

We conducted three laboratory Population cage trials, each lasting 16-25 wk. We tested two broad hypotheses. First, Ae. aegypti raised in containers seeded with 10(8) AeDNV genome equivalents/ml (geq/ml), a concentration feasible for field application, increase AeDNV to concentrations that cause significant adult and larval mortality. Second, infected female mosquitoes disperse AeDNV to uninfected larval habitats. In hypothesis 1, we addressed the rate at which infected larvae secrete virus, how AeDNV titers change in seeded containers over time, whether AeDNV decays over time, and whether AeDNV exposed Populations are reduced. In hypothesis 2, we monitored AeDNV concentrations in novel containers after oviposition by infected females. Both hypotheses were Supported. Larvae increased AeDNV, secreting virus at a rate of 2.14 x 10(6) geq/larva/d when exposed to 10(8) geq/ml. AeDNV titers reached an asymptote of 10(10) geq/ml by week 10 in seeded containers. AeDNV decayed by 1 log every 4 d as indicated by a reduction in larval mortality. Adult Population size was reduced in treated populations. Infected females dispersed AeDNV to novel containers, with titers reaching 10(8) geq/ml. The parameters were used in a Leslie-Lewis matrix model. This model predicted that AeDNV negatively affects Ae. aegypti densities and Population structure and thus vectorial capacity.","Aedes aegypti Densonucleosis Virus Amplifies Spreads and Reduces Host Populations in Laboratory Cage Studies","Aedes densonucleosis Virus (family Parvoviridae, genus Brevidensovirus, AeDNV) is a mosquito pathogen that increases Aedes aegypti larval mortality and reduces adult life span.

The median lethal concentrations (LC50) of the four most virulent isolates ranged from 4.9 x 10(5) to 2.0 x 10(6) cfu/ml with estimated time to kill 50% of the insects ranging from 4.6 to 5.3 d. The effect of a sublethal dose (ca. LD50) of either B. bassiana EABb 01/103-Su or M. anisopliae EAMa 01/58-Su isolate was studied by reciprocal crossing. Treatment with B. bassiana reduced fecundity and fertility at 6, 8, and 10 d after treatment, with fecundity and fertility reductions ranging from 20.0 to 71.2% and from 33.6 to 60.0%, respectively. These reductions occurred in pairing combinations of treated females with either treated or nontreated males. M. anisophae was more effective in reducing fecundity and fertility at 6 d after treatment, with the reduction varying from 58.4 to 72.1% and from 28.6 to 45.9%, respectively. In addition, the first oviposition was significantly delayed for I d in females treated by either fungal species. The above-mentioned five selected isolates were assayed against C. capitata puparia treated as late third instars in sterilized soil at 25 degrees C under three moisture conditions (-0.1, -0.01, and -0.0055 MPa). At -0.01 MPa, all isolates were low pathogenic to C. capitata puparia, whereas significant differences in the puparia mortality occurred between isolates at -0.1 and -0.0055 MPa. The highest pupal mortalities ranged from 52.5 to 70.0%, as a function of soil moisture and were caused by EAMa 01/58-Su and Bb-1333 isolates.","pathogenicity, mortality rate, fecundity, fertility, laboratory evaluation","","Article","Quesada-Moraga, E.

The present study estimated the effects of temperature on duration of the gonotrophic cycle and on maturation of the ovaries of An. albimanus. Blood fed adult mosquitoes were exposed to temperatures of 24, 2 7, and 30 degrees C, held individually in oviposition cages and assessed at 12 h intervals. At 24, 27, and 30 degrees C the mean development time of the oocytes was 91.2 h (95% C.I.: 865-96), 662 h (61.5-70.8), and 73.1 h (64-82.3), respectively.

These findings indicate that both parameters in An. albimanus are reduced when temperatures rose from 24 to 30 degrees C, in a nonlinear manner. According to these results the increase in malaria transmission during El Nino in Colombia could be associated with a shortening of the gonotrophic cycle in malaria vectors, which could enhance the frequency of man-vector contact, affecting the incidence of the disease.","Laboratory estimation of the effects of increasing temperatures on the duration of gonotrophic cycle of Anopheles albimanus Diptera Culicidae","The increase of malaria transmission in the Pacific Coast of Colombia during the occurrence of El Nino warm event has been found not to be linked to increases in the density of the vector Anopheles albimanus, but to other temperature-sensitive variables such as longevity, duration of the gonotrophic cycle or the sporogonic period of Plasmodium.

At higher densities, larvae spent more time gathering food and were engaged in aggressive or antagonistic behaviors.","food availability, intraspecific competition, aggressive behavior, larval density, antagonistic behavior","","Article","Frouz, Jan (frouz@upb.cas.cz) ; Lobinske, Richard J.; Ali, Arshad","Frouz, Jan; Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Soil Biol, Ctr Biol, Na Sadkach 7, CR-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Aquatic Ecology","2009","43","2","487","500","10.1007/s10452-008-9178-7","English","WoS_BIOSIS_CitIndex"

Four significant changes were determined. The first change was a reduction in the preoviposition period form the G(p) to G(I). The second was that wild female flies had difficulty ovipositing in an artificial substrate, yielding the lowest fecundity rates observed throughout the experiment. The third significant change was a decrease in longevity and life expectancy from G(p) to G(I), which then continued to decrease with successive generation. This resulted in a lab strain with high fecundity limited to a short period of oviposition. The last significant change was reduction in larval and pupal weight.

Since April 2001, longitudinal field-and laboratory-based active dengue surveillance has been carried out in Chennai to study dengue trends. Method: A serologic survey of people in Chennai using the hemagglutination inhibition test (HIT) was performed to determine evidence of prior exposure to dengue virus infections. Dengue virus infections and their serotypes were demonstrated in vectors. The serum samples from clinical dengue patients were analyzed for dengue virus-specific immunoglobulins M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies by 2 commercial ELISA kits. Results: There was an increase in the percentage of children with monotypic antibody responses to dengue in the later survey (April 2.2%, September 9.93%). DEN-3 serotype infections were demonstrated in male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected in September 2001. Dengue virus infection was diagnosed in 74.5% (143/192) of cases. While dengue-specific IgM responses were predominant among infants with dengue fever, IgG and mixed responses (M + G) were seen in 85% of the children with severe forms of dengue. Conclusion: The findings from these investigations suggest that antibody surveys in children and virus detection in vectors may be included as early warning system parameters in laboratory-based proactive dengue surveillance.","Field- and laboratory-based active dengue surveillance in Chennai Tamil Nadu India Observations before and during the 2001 dengue epidemic","Background: Dengue cases are reported every year in the city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

However, there is no information about the potential causes underlying these large-scale events. In the summer of 2002, a sudden massive mortality almost decimated the yellow clam population located to the south of Isla del Jabali (Argentina), at the southern edge of its geographical range.

Mortality sequentially occurred at the beach in a north-south direction, following the same trend as in the large-scale event. Significant differences in individual size were found between dead and live clams with the largest individuals of the population being the most affected. Histologic analysis revealed the presence of a meront stage of an unidentified coccidian parasite in the epithelium of the middle intestine of 3 of the 14 clams examined. Necrosis was found in gills and stomach in 13 of the 14 clams examined. The results suggest that these parasites could play a role in the massive mortality events of the yellow clam populations all along South American sandy beaches since 1993.

Pieces of formulated mycelium (2X2X0.5 mm) placed on bean and cowpea foliage in the field showed a temporal pattern of nightly conidial discharge similar to the fungus on leafhopper cadavers; both fungi initiated sporulation within a few hours following dewset and ceased with the return of dry conditions after 08:00 h. However, sporulation of the fungus on cadavers peaked between 00:00 and 03:00 h, while peak sporulation of the formulated fungus usually occurred shortly after dawn. Fungus on adult leafhopper cadavers and the pieces of formulated fungus underwent multiple daytime desiccation/nighttime rehydration cycles, producing conidia for up to eight consecutive nights. Second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-instar cadavers supported sporulation for only 5-6 nights. On a dry weight basis, the fungus on cadavers produced substantially more conidia than the formulated fungus; however, differences were less pronounced based on the surface area of the hymenium. In general, the dried-mycelium pieces generated conidia in a manner similar (both temporally and quantitatively) to the fungus on leafhopper cadavers.

At these temperatures the highest intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm=0.012) was observed as well as the lowest mean generation time (T=303.8 degree-day and T=272 degree-day, respectively) and population doubling time (TD=57.8 degree-day).","generation time, intrinsic rate of natural increase, life tables (age-specific) , population doubling time, population dynamics, population growth, temperature, thermal requirements","degree-day model; mathematical and computer techniques/leaf cage; laboratory equipment","Article","Cividanes, Francisco J.

A field bioassay was developed to study the in situ effects of sediment contamination on Chironomus riparius larvae. The survival, development rate and increase in Chironomus larvae biomass was compared between laboratory bioassays with the field cages. The incidence of mentum deformities was compared not only between laboratory and field bioassays but also with observations on field populations of Chironomus larvae. Survival in the field bioassays was slightly higher than the laboratory, except at locations with known contamination of the surface water. The influence of surface water quality in field bioassays was demonstrated in translocation experiments, in which clean sediment was placed in a polluted site, and vice versa. In a field bioassay carried out in the autumn, an inverse relationship between the rate of development and the initial larval density in the field cages was apparent. In addition, in the field bioassays with C. riparius considerable seasonal variation in the survival and incidence of mentum deformities was found. Field bioassays performed during the winter season indicate that low temperatures can interact with or add to the effects of sediment contamination on chironomid populations.","In situ bioassays with Chironomus riparius Laboratory-field comparisons of sediment toxicity and effects during wintering","A field bioassay was developed to study the in situ effects of sediment contamination on Chironomus riparius larvae.

The impact of predation by the generalist carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) on populations of the field slug Deroceras reticulatum (Muller), and the effects of prey size on the predator-prey interaction, were measured under semi-field conditions. It was hypothesized that environmental heterogeneity would lead to very different patterns of comparative mortality than might be deduced from size choice experiments conducted in the laboratory. Results from outdoor mini-plots, emulating conditions in a field of wheat, demonstrated that P. melanarius significantly reduced numbers of slugs from all size classes, with no apparent preferences. This was in marked contrast to results from earlier laboratory studies, where this beetle fed preferentially on the smallest slugs. The slugs in the mini-plots ranged in size from 2-100 mg and the numbers in the mini-plot reflected the size frequency distribution in the field. Beetles in mini-plots containing high densities of slugs increased significantly in weight, in contrast to beetles in mini-plots with low slug density or no added slugs, which did not. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), using anti-slug monoclonal antibodies, showed that where there was a higher density of slugs there was more slug protein in the guts of the beetles. It was concluded that environmental heterogeneity probably provided a greater number and diversity of refugia for smaller than for larger slugs, counteracting laboratory-measured size preferences measured in arenas without refugia. These results have implications for a range of ecological studies involving inter- and intra-specific prey size choice, and emphasize the dangers of extrapolating from the laboratory to the field.","Predation and prey size choice by the carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius Coleoptera Carabidae The dangers of extrapolating from laboratory to field","The impact of predation by the generalist carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) on populations of the field slug Deroceras reticulatum (Muller), and the effects of prey size on the predator-prey interaction, were measured under semi-field conditions.

The respective controls contained no earthworms. All of them were kept at 18degreeC and 20% moisture for 21 days. After this period of time the microcosms were tested and microarthropods were extracted, identified and counted. In general, more microarthropods were recovered from the soils without earthworms. There were significant differences between the soils with respect to the abundance of Collembola (Isotomidae and Sminthuridae), and Acari (Gamasida and Oribatida). The results suggest that, under the experimental conditions employed, H. elisae reduces the abundance of these groups of microarthropods. This may be due to several reasons. A change in environmental heterogeneity produced by H. elisae is suggested.

This provided a rare opportunity to assess the impact of a new, large carnivore on a community that has been studied since the 1970s and has one of the most detailed food webs yet published. The vulnerability of the resident species to the invader was assessed by integrating experiments, which examined discrete stages in the predation sequence, with empirical survey data. 2. Although the new predator preyed on nearly every macro-invertebrate in the food web, vulnerability varied considerably among prey species. Size-related handling constraints initially set the predator's diet, resulting in strong ontogenetic shifts, with progressively larger prey being added while small prey were retained in the diet, as predators grew. Within the size range of vulnerable prey, encounter rate limited the strength of predation, with mobile, epibenthic species being most at risk. Contrary to most studies of interactions between freshwater predators (usually stoneflies) and prey (usually mayflies), the new predator did not elicit avoidance responses from its prey, probably because it combined a highly cryptic feeding posture with an extremely rapid attack response. 3. The invader exploited its prey heavily in experiments, even at prey densities orders of magnitude above ambient. In the field, electivity reflected prey availability, as determined by mobility and microhabitat use, rather than prey abundance or active predator choice. Consequently, the invader had skewed effects within the prey assemblage, with sedentary, interstitial species being far less vulnerable than more active, epibenthic species, some of which, including a previous top predator, have declined markedly since the invasion. 4. By examining the predation sequence in detail and integrating surveys with experiments, species traits and system characteristics that determine the strength of trophic interactions may be identified, and their potential importance in natural food webs assessed. In so doing, greater insight can be gained into which species (and systems) will be most vulnerable to invading or exotic predators, an imperative in both pure and applied ecology.","Differential vulnerability of prey to an invading top predator Integrating field surveys and laboratory experiments","1.

We analyzed the morphological differences between a wild population and its laboratory descendants, using the techniques of geometric morphometry, with the idea that such differences might parallel those between sylvatic and synanthropic populations. The analyses over five generations showed differences in size but not in shape. Head size and wing size were both reduced from sylvatic to laboratory populations, but the decrease in head size occurred only up to the second generation while the decrease in wing size proceeded up to the fifth generation. In contrast, although a decrease in sexual size dimorphism has been proposed as a marker of colonization in human dwellings, we did not detect any significant loss of dimorphism between sexes of P. geniculatus over the five generations studied. We conclude that size changes may have a physiological origin in response to a change of ecotopes, but more than five generations may be required for the expression of permanent morphological markers of human dwellings colonization.","Geometric morphometric differences between Panstrongylus geniculatus from field and laboratory","The finding of Panstrongylus geniculatus nymphs inside a house in northeastern Antioquia, Colombia, and the reports related to their increasing presence in homes suggest the need for surveillance methods for monitoring the invasion processes.

All cages were equipped with plastic beakers that served as sites for oviposition and larval development. We measured the per capita daily mortality and emergence rates of the adults and size of adult females, and estimated the intrinsic rate of increase (r) and asymptotic density (K) for each caged population. Populations at 26degreeC had greater intrinsic rates of increase and lower asymptotic densities than populations at 22 and 24degreeC. Populations at high temperatures initially had greater daily per capita emergence rates, and steeper declines in per capita emergence rate as density increased over the course of the experiment. There was no temperature effect on the size of adult females nor on the per capita daily mortality rate of adults. Results indicated that populations of Ae. albopictus occurring in regions with relatively high summer temperatures are likely to have high rates of population growth with populations of adults peaking early in the season. These populations may attain relatively low peak densities of adults. Populations occurring in regions with low summer temperatures are likely to experience slow, steady production of adults throughout the season with population size peaking later in the season, and may attain higher peak densities of adults. High temperature conditions, associated with climate change, may increase the rate of spread of Ae. albopictus by increasing rates of increase and by enhancing colonization due to rapid population growth.","Temperature effects on the dynamics of Aedes albopictus Diptera Culicidae populations in the laboratory","We investigated how constant temperatures of 22, 24, and 26degreeC experienced across the full life cycle affected the dynamics of caged populations of Aedes albopictus (Skuse).

Benthic samples were randomly collected from each wetland at least once every month. Geocoordinates, water depth, and physical composition of substrates at each larval sample location were noted. Adult midge populations were sampled weekly around the wetlands by employing 10 New Jersey light traps permanently placed in the area. Chironominae and Tanypodinae midges occurred in the larval and adult samples; a few Orthocladiinae were also taken. Among Chironominae, Chironomini (mostly Polypedilum spp., Cryptochironomus spp., Glyptotendipes paripes, and Goeldichironomus carus) and Tanytarsini (mostly Tanytarsus spp.), and some other Chironomidae were recorded. Tanypodinae were quantitatively not important. Monthly mean number of total adults per trap-night ranged from 23 in February to 211 in October. Annual mean larval density and range of total chironomids in the study wetlands amounted to 1,128/m(2), range: 0-12,332/m(2). The total larvae were most abundant in May. Tanytarsus spp. and Polypedilum spp. were numerically the most predominant spatially as well as temporally.

Predictable changes in the composition of macroinvertebrate communities in response to non-point source pollution are the basis of macroinvertebrate community indices. However, other factors, such as biotic interactions, also affect the composition of macroinvertebrate communities and may complicate the interpretation of such indices by interacting with abiotic stressors.2. The effect of agricultural pollutants on competition between two filter-feeding caddisflies, Brachycentrus appalachia and Hydropsyche spp. was studied in the laboratory using recirculating flow tanks.3. Experiments were conducted at two densities of Hydropsyche: high (300 per tank) and low (80 per tank). Brachycentrus density was kept constant at 40 per tank in all experiments. Experiments assessed the effect of an agricultural pollutant mix (sand, cow-manure compost mix) and the presence of the competitor on both taxa.4. The only negative response to pollutants was a larger number of Hydropsyche drifting in high-density tanks. In fact, at high densities, mortality of Hydropsyche was higher in controls than in tanks receiving pollutants.5. Hydropsyche and B. appalachia competed for resources and the presence of pollution did not affect the outcome of this competition. The presence of high densities of Hydropsyche resulted in higher drift and lower condition of B. appalachia. At low densities of Hydropsyche, B. appalachia larvae suffered greater mortality and tended to be in poorer condition. Brachycentrus appalachia may be less successful at even moderate densities of Hydropsyche due to competition between these taxa, most likely for prime feeding positions.6. Streams receiving non-point source pollution from agriculture may be able to support higher densities of Hydropsyche, which may further reduce the suitability of these habitats for B. appalachia.7. This experimental study suggests that competition may complicate interpretation of biotic indices, as changes in benthic invertebrate community structure normally ascribed to pollution may arise from intra-specific competition.","Do agricultural pollutants affect competition between filter-feeding caddis fly larvae Results of laboratory microcosm experiments","1.

Effects on O. concolor were large, and significant reductions in longevity, percentage of attacked hosts, and progeny size per female, were recorded. The predator P. maculiventris was much less sensitive to azadirachtin, but slight reductions in survival of emerged adults and of reproductive parameters occurred. The insecticide had no significant effect on C. carnea larvae fed with treated Sitotroga cerealella (Oliver) eggs, probably because of its inability to penetrate inside the egg.","Laboratory effects of ingestion of azadirachtin by two pests Ceratitis capitata and Spodoptera exigua and three natural enemies Chrysoperla carnea Opius concolor and Podisus maculiventris","The effects of azadirachtin on two pests: neonate larvae and newly emerged adults of Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) and last instar larvae of Spodoptera exigua (Hubner); and three natural enemies: newly emerged adults of Opius concolor Szepligeti, second instar larvae of Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens), and fifth instar nymphs of Podisus maculiventris (Say) were studied in laboratory.

Twenty-one sampling stations were categorized into groups based on five degrees of AMD input: (1) none, (2) intermittent acidic/circum-neutral AMD, (3) continuous acidic AMD, (4) continuous circum-neutral AMD, and (5) receiving system stations with at least two levels of dilution. Bioassessment techniques included water/sediment chemistry, benthic macroinvertebrate sampling, laboratory acute water column toxicity testing, laboratory chronic sediment toxicity testing, and in situ toxicity testing with Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea (Muller)). Group 3 stations had significantly altered water chemistry (low pH, high conductivity, and high water column metals) relative to the other groups and significantly higher sediment iron concentrations. Both group 3 and group 4 stations had significantly decreased ephemeroptera-plecoptera-trichoptera richness and percent ephemeroptera abundance relative to unimpacted stations. Group 3 stations also had decreased total taxon richness. Water column toxicity testing was sensitive to AMD impacts, with samples from group 3 stations being significantly more toxic than those from groups 2 and 4, which in turn were more toxic than those from groups 1 and 5. Similar results were observed for in situ toxicity testing. No differences in sediment toxicity test survival and impairment results were observed among the station groups. Stepwise multiple linear regression and simple bivariate correlation analyses were used to select parameters for use in an ecotoxicologic rating system, which was successful in differentiating between two levels of environmental impact relative to stations receiving no AMD input.","Laboratory to field validation in an integrative assessment of an acid mine drainage-impacted watershed","An integrative assessment was conducted in the Puckett's Creek watershed of southwestern Virginia, USA, to investigate the environmental impacts of acid mine drainage (AMD) inputs.

Laboratory and field experiments were carried out on eggs, larvae and adults of this ladybird to determine the effects of three insect growth regulators (IGRs) used against citrus pests in the region. Two chitin synthesis inhibitors, buprofezin and teflubenzuron, and a juvenile hormone analog, pyriproxyfen, were applied to C. nigritus populations at the recommended dosages. Mortality and development of egg and larval stages, as well as mortality and fecundity of the adults were recorded. Laboratory experiments indicated that, of the three IGRs tested, buprofezin was the most detrimental compound, especially to larval stages, irrespective of whether the larvae were fed IGR-treated A. aurantii directly or sprayed with IGRs. Immediate larval mortality from pyriproxyfen and teflubenzuron was not significantly different from the controls. None of the larvae that were fed with IGR-treated A. aurantii pupated. By contrast, larvae that had only been sprayed with IGRs pupated, but no adults emerged. Adult fecundity was not affected by exposure to IGRs, either in the laboratory or in the field, but all eggs exposed to IGRs failed to hatch. Although larvae developed to the adult stage in the field experiments, the IGRs' ovicidal activity and effects on immature stages still had a detrimental effect on C. nigritus population levels. As a result, spraying of IGRs is likely to impede C. nigritus population increases in citrus orchards. This emphasizes the need to avoid spraying during C. nigritus population increases should the use of IGRs be unavoidable. Insect growth regulator's impact on non-target species still requires further consideration, especially with the incorporation of these chemicals into integrated pest management programmes.","Effects of insect growth regulators on Chilocorus nigritus Fabricius Coleoptera Coccinellidae a non-target natural enemy of citrus red scale Aonidiella aurantii Maskell Homoptera Diaspididae in southern Africa Evidence from laboratory and field trials","Chilocorus nigritus (Fabricius) is one of the major coccinellid predators of the citrus pest Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) in southern Africa.

The adult stage of a New Zealand native weevil, Nicaeana cervina (Broun) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Entiminae), was used as a test insect as this has become well-adapted to introduced pasture species, feeding on both ryegrass [Lolium perenne L. (Poaceae)] and white clover [Trifolium repens L. (Fabaceae)]. Ryegrass plants used in experiments were infected with strains of the symbiotic endophytic fungi Neotyphodium lolii (Latch, M.J. Chr. & Samuels) and Epichloe festucae Leuchtm., Schardl & M.R. Siegel and included a transgenic endophyte, which was modified to eliminate production of the insect deterrent, peramine. Nicaeana cervina was exposed to these endophyte-infected plants along with endophyte-free ryegrass. Weevils were also exposed to white clover with high or low levels of cyanogens, and to white clover selections bred conventionally to contain high or low levels of crude protein. These bioassays were carried out sometimes over a series of time intervals, and weevil survival, feeding, and reproductive performance variables were measured. Nicaeana cervina survival was generally high, although feeding and oviposition were variable between experiments despite high replication in some cases. A summary of significant differences obtained across all experiments suggested that data on the proportion of weevils feeding and amounts of leaf material consumed were more often significantly different than treatment effects on survival or reproductive performance. A positive relationship between the proportion of weevils feeding and those ovipositing was found, suggesting that a 50% reduction in feeding would result in a 28% reduction in the proportion of weevils ovipositing. Power analysis using the range of values recorded for the variables measured indicated that for proportions of weevils surviving, feeding, or fecund, about 35-42 replicates would be required for a 40% difference in values. For measures of leaf consumption and numbers of eggs per female, fewer replicates were required for 95% power when these values were at the higher end of the range than when they were at the lower end of the observed range.

In the laboratory, forest soil humus containing naturally occurring microarthropods was heated in plastic bags to avoid desiccation. Each sample was heated to one of 11 different temperatures between 20 and 60 degrees C for 1, 4, or 12 h.

Under Laboratory and Field Conditions Plants emit a wide range of volatile organic compounds in response to damage by herbivores, and many of the compounds have been shown to attract the natural enemies of insect herbivores or serve for inter- and intra-plant communication. Most studies have focused on volatile emission in the laboratory while little is known about emission patterns in the field. We studied the emission of volatiles by Trifolium pratense (red clover) under both laboratory and field conditions. The emission of 24 compounds was quantified in the laboratory, of which eight showed increased emission rates after herbivory by Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars, including (E)-beta-ocimene, the most abundant compound, (Z)-beta-ocimene, linalool, (E)-beta-caryophyllene, (E,E)-alpha-farnesene, 4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), 1-octen-3-ol, and methyl salicylate (MeSA). While most of these compounds have been reported as herbivore-induced volatiles from a wide range of plant taxa, 1-octen-3-ol seems to be a characteristic volatile of legumes. In the field, T. pratense plants with varying herbivore damage growing in established grassland communities emitted only 13 detectable compounds, and the correlation between herbivore damage and volatile release was more variable than in the laboratory. For example, the emission of (E)-beta-ocimene, (Z)-beta-ocimene, and DMNT actually declined with damage, while decanal exhibited increased emission with increasing herbivory. Elevated light and temperature increased the emission of many compounds, but the differences in light and temperature conditions between the laboratory and the field could not account for the differences in emission profiles. Our results indicate that the release of volatiles from T. pratense plants in the field is likely to be influenced by additional biotic and abiotic factors not measured in this study. The elucidation of these factors may be important in understanding the physiological and ecological functions of volatiles in plants.","Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds After Herbivory from Trifolium pratense L Under Laboratory and Field Conditions","Plants emit a wide range of volatile organic compounds in response to damage by herbivores, and many of the compounds have been shown to attract the natural enemies of insect herbivores or serve for inter- and intra-plant communication.

Chlorantraniliprole, a relatively new nonrepellent, slow acting termiticide has been shown to be capable of being transferred among colony members through social interactions, and thus may be effective beyond its original site of application. Using field grids, we evaluated the colony-level effects of chlorantraniliprole on H. aureus foraging activity. Repeated laboratory soil bioassays at 3, 15, 27 and 39 mo postapplication were performed to determine the effects of chlorantraniliprole on termite mortality and tunneling activity. Additionally, field tests of chlorantraniliprole were completed on 10 structures infested with H. aureus. In the experimental grids, the zone surrounded by a chlorantraniliprole perimeter was the only section in which a significant decrease in the number of termites collected occurred, but this was observed in both treatment and controls plots. Overall, no significant colony-level effects of chlorantraniliprole application were observed within the grids. Laboratory bioassays resulted in high mortality and significantly lower tunneling activity of exposed termites at all time points. In structures, the initial application of chlorantraniliprole was sufficient to control infestations in 6 out of 10 cases without supplemental applications. Additional treatments were confined to areas that had not been treated previously. Results show that chlorantraniliprole is capable of achieving control of desert subterranean termites under most conditions. This is likely a result of its high toxicity instead of colony-level effects resulting from termiticide transfer.","Field and Laboratory Evaluations of Chlorantraniliprole as a Termiticide in Southern Arizona","The desert subterranean termite, Heterotermes aureus (Snyder), is the predominant termite of economic importance in the arid southwest.

However, work to date has focused almost entirely on the impacts of single, usually dominant, species. Here we ask whether multiple, coexisting species of hydropsychid caddisfly larvae have different impacts on sediment mobility compared to single-species systems due to competitive interactions and niche differences. We manipulated the presence of two common species of net-spinning caddisfly (Ceratopsyche oslari, Arctopsyche californica) in laboratory mesocosms and measured how their silk filtration nets influence the critical shear stress required to initiate sediment grain motion when they were in monoculture versus polyculture. We found that critical shear stress increases non-additively in polycultures where species were allowed to interact. Critical shear stress was 26% higher in multi-species assemblages compared to the average single-species monoculture, and 21% greater than levels of stability achieved by the species having the largest impact on sediment motion in monoculture. Supplementary behavioral experiments suggest the non-additive increase in critical shear stress may have occurred as competition among species led to shifts in the spatial distribution of the two populations and complementary habitat use. To explore the implications of these results for field conditions, we used results from the laboratory study to parameterize a common model of sediment transport. We then used this model to estimate potential bed movement in a natural stream for which we had measurements of channel geometry, grain size, and daily discharge. Although this extrapolation is speculative, it illustrates that multi-species impacts could be sufficiently large to reduce bedload sediment flux over annual time scales in streams where multiple species of caddisfly are present.","Non-Additive Increases in Sediment Stability Are Generated by Macroinvertebrate Species Interactions in Laboratory Streams","Previous studies have shown that biological structures such as plant roots can have large impacts on landscape morphodynamics, and that physical models that do not incorporate biology can generate qualitatively incorrect predictions of sediment transport.

Host plants play an important role in the population increases and outbreaks of O. nipae. O. nipae could not complete its development on the Majestic palm (Ravenea rivularis Jumelle & Perrier), and females did not lay eggs on Chinese fan palm (Livistona chinensis R. Brown). However, this insect species both completed development and laid eggs on Chinese windmill palm (Trachycarpus fortunei (Hooker) H.

The demographic characteristics of O. nipae reared on Chinese windmill palm, Canary Island date palm, and pygmy date palm were compared with an age-stage, two-sex life table. In this study, the developmental periods from egg to adult varied from 42.1 d on Chinese windmill palm to 49.8 d on pygmy date palm. The survivorship from egg to adult on Chinese windmill palm, Canary Island date palm, and pygmy date palm was 77.5, 79.4, and 66.7%, respectively. Although the adult longevity and the mean fecundity for individuals reared on Chinese windmill palm, Canary Island date palm, and pygmy date palm were not significantly different, there were significant differences in the intrinsic rate of increase, the finite rate, and the mean generation time among palm species, and the values of intrinsic rate of increase and finite rate were higher for populations reared on Chinese windmill palm and Canary Island date palm (0.0313 and 1.0318 d(-1) and 0.0278 and 1.0282 d(-1), respectively) and lower for populations reared on pygmy date palm (0.0192 and 1.0194 d(-1)). However, mean generation time was shorter on Chinese windmill palm (124.11 d) and Canary Island date palm (129.62 d) and longer on pygmy date palm (166.03 d).

In recent years, there has been an increase in the introduction of T. parva-infected buffaloes onto private game parks in Northern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). The objectives of this study were to investigate the number of T. parva outbreaks in cattle at the livestock/wildlife interface and to establish the possible T. parva carrier status in cattle which were diagnosed to have recovered from clinical disease.The occurrence of outbreaks was closely monitored from 2004 to 2009 covering a total of 15 localities. The observations included the number of cattle involved in the outbreaks, clinical signs, parasitological and post-mortem examinations, as well as serological and molecular tests specific for T. parva. Sentinel cattle were introduced to monitor tick transmission and some of these recovered from clinical T. parva infection in the field and confirmed to be positive by PCR, were challenged using lethal T. parva stabilates to ascertain their immune status.Thirty-one Corridor disease outbreaks were recorded during the study period. Of the 846 cattle tested for Corridor disease during the study period, 140(16.5%) were found positive by the real time PCR and IFA tests. Eighty-two (9.7%) cattle were found positive by the IFA test only. The prevalence of T. parva infection was 26.2%. Adult R. appendiculatus fed as nymphs on 5 bovines which recovered from clinical T. parva infection in the field transmitted only T. taurotragi to susceptible bovines. However, 8 of the field-recovered cattle resisted lethal challenge using T. parva tick stabilate. Though the study could not demonstrate cattle-to-cattle transmission by ticks using 5 previously infected cattle in the field, it is suggested that Corridor disease should be considered a potential emerging disease, and more stringent control methods should be implemented.

(Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) has long attracted attention not only as a serious pest of numerous agricultural crops, but also as a species expanding its range in many parts of the world. Nezara viridula has also been widely used as a model in different experimental studies. The present review focuses on reproductive (i.e. adult) winter diapause, which is the pivotal element of the species' seasonal cycle. Results from numerous field experiments and observations, as well as laboratory ecophysiological investigations conducted during the few last decades, are analyzed and interpreted. Experimental findings are used to describe in detail the dynamics of physiological changes during overwintering. Reproductive diapause in N. viridula is controlled in both sexes by photoperiodic conditions. The induction of diapause is associated with a reversible change of body colour from green or yellow to russet (or brown). The proper timing of adult emergence and the induction of diapause, as well as the size of adults, is vitally important for successful overwintering. Nezara viridula has been shown to respond strongly to the current trend in climate change by shifting the limit of its northern range, particularly in central Japan. Analysis of historic climate data suggests that the environmental conditions during the last few decades have become more favourable for the overwintering survival of N. viridula in many locations in central Japan. This has likely promoted the northward spread of the species. The relationships between reproductive diapause, reversible body colour change, overwintering success and the recent range expansion are analyzed. Perspectives of the range dynamics of the species are discussed in light of further predicted climate change.","Surviving winter diapause syndrome in the southern green stink bug Nezara viridula in the laboratory in the field and under climate change conditions","The southern green stink bug Nezara viridula (L.)

Studies conducted during the past two decades have demonstrated the presence of toxic concentrations of heavy metals in slag-based sandy sediments, including cadmium, copper, zinc, and lead in the UCR area as well as the downstream reservoir portion of Lake Roosevelt. We conducted standardized whole-sediment toxicity tests with the amphipod Hyalella azteca (28-day) and the midge Chironomus dilutus (10-day) on 11 samples, including both UCR and study-specific reference sediments. Metal concentrations in sediments were modeled for potential toxicity using three approaches: (1) probable effects quotients (PEQs) based on total recoverable metals (TRMs) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEMs); (2) SEMs corrected for acid-volatile sulfides (AVS; i.e., aSEM - AVS); and (3) aSEM - AVS normalized to the fractional organic carbon (f(oc)) (i.e., aSEM - AVS/f(oc)). The most highly metal-contaminated sample (aPEQ(TRM) = 132; aPEQ(SEM) = 54; aSEM - AVS = 323; and aSEM - AVS/(foc) = 64,600 umol/g) from the UCR was dominated by weathered slag sediment particles and resulted in 80% mortality and 94% decrease in biomass of amphipods; in addition, this sample significantly decreased growth of midge by 10%. The traditional aAVS - SEM, uncorrected for organic carbon, was the most accurate approach for estimating the effects of metals in the UCR. Treatment of the toxic slag sediment with 20% Resinex SIR-300 metal-chelating resin significantly decreased the toxicity of the sample. Samples aSEM - AVS > 244 was not toxic to amphipods or midge in laboratory testing, indicating that this value may be an approximate threshold for effects in the UCR. In situ benthic invertebrate colonization studies in an experimental pond (8-week duration) indicated that two of the most metal-contaminated UCR sediments (dominated by high levels of sand-sized slag particles) exhibited decreased invertebrate colonization compared with sand-based reference sediments. Field-exposed SIR-300 resin samples also exhibited decreased invertebrate colonization numbers compared with reference materials, which may indicate behavioral avoidance of this material under field conditions. Multiple lines of evidence (analytical chemistry, laboratory toxicity, and field colonization results), along with findings from previous studies, indicate that high metal concentrations associated with slag-enriched sediments in the UCR are likely to adversely impact the growth and survival of native benthic invertebrate communities. Additional laboratory toxicity testing, refinement of the applications of sediment benchmarks for metal toxicity, and in situ benthic invertebrate studies will assist in better defining the spatial extent, temporal variations, and ecological impacts of metal-contaminated sediments in the UCR system.","Laboratory Toxicity and Benthic Invertebrate Field Colonization of Upper Columbia River Sediments Finding Adverse Effects Using Multiple Lines of Evidence","From 1930 to 1995, the Upper Columbia River (UCR) of northeast Washington State received approximately 12 million metric tons of smelter slag and associated effluents from a large smelter facility located in Trail, British Columbia, approximately 10 km north of the United States-Canadian border.

Among these are the factors regulating the adult diapause. Reports of recent studies questioned the validity of earlier reports of diapause in L. hesperus, in part because of the demonstrated loss of diapause response in insects obtained from long-standing laboratory colonies. However, use of laboratory reared insects would facilitate additional diapause research, so long as those insects exhibit a diapause response similar to that of the field population. L. hesperus, originating as eggs from field-collected insects, were reared in the laboratory for four generations to examine corresponding changes in selected biological characteristics. Over the course of the four generations, incidence of diapause in both L. hesperus genders decreased whereas the frequency of oviposition by virgin females increased. Measurable changes were not observed in frequency of occurrence of a specific fat body type (glass bead fat) or nymphal development time. These results suggest L. hesperus used in diapause research should be as close to the field population as possible, but no further removed than three generations. Results further demonstrate variability among different biological characteristics in their responses to selection from laboratory rearing. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the influences of rearing on specific biological characteristics under study, and the need to verify the similarity of laboratory-reared insects to their native counterparts in studies used to draw inferences regarding the field population.","Physiological Consequences of Laboratory Rearing of Lygus hesperus Hemiptera Miridae","Several aspects of the basic biology of the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus Knight, are poorly known despite the economic importance of this species.

However, many fruits are not exported because of quarantine restrictions imposed by importing countries. A survey in the state has detected a considerable increase of the fruit fly, Anastrepha zenildae Zucchi (Diptera: Tephritidae), probably a result of the introduction of irrigated guava orchards that make fruit available all year. Knowledge of the sexual behavior of Tephritidae has great importance to pest control programs, particularly those that employ the Sterile Insect Technique. In order to characterize the reproductive behavior of A. zenildae, 32 individuals (16 males; 16 females) in each of six generations were submitted to an artificial 12: 12 L:D cycle (750: < 1 lux, lights on 07:00-19:00) and observed over their lifetimes. The courtship and copulation occurred in leks and the episodes varied with the time of day, courtship being most frequent between zeitgeber time (ZT) 3 and ZT 7, peaking at ZT 5-6.

The threat of this pest to regional small and stone fruit production industries led to investigations on its overwintering capabilities in fruit-growing regions in the Pacific Northwest. Knowledge of its cold tolerance will help in the development of computer models to forecast seasonal population growth and decline.RESULTS: Of 1500 adults or pupae, 22 (1.4%) individuals survived the 84 day experimental chilling period. Most (86%) of the survivors were subjected to 10 degrees C temperature treatments. Survival decreased significantly at lower temperature treatments. Freezing temporarily increased the mortality rate but did not significantly affect overall mortality over the trial period. Flies that emerged from pupae are estimated to survive for up to 103-105 days at 10 degrees C and for shorter periods at lower temperatures. Field trapping in five fruit production areas has demonstrated overwintering survival in California and Oregon, but lower survival is predicted in Eastern Washington and Michigan.CONCLUSION: The experiments reported here indicate that long-term survival of D. suzukii is unlikely at temperatures below 10 degrees C.

We calculated stage-specific developmental times, age-specific mortality and fecundity, stage-specific and total preadult mortality, and the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(0) = 0.21), the finite population growth rate (lambda = 1.23), the net reproductive rate (R-0 = 314.24), and the generation time (T = 21.45 wk). Elasticity analysis showed that the dominant life-history traits determining lambda were the adult female survival, and the survival of instar V nymphs (molting into adult females). Adult females dominated the stage-specific reproductive value, and the egg stage dominated the stable stage distribution (SSD). The damping ratio (rho = 1.11) suggests a relatively rapid period of recovery to a disturbed SSD. Results were compared with previous values from the literature and conform relatively well, considering that environmental conditions were not always the same.

In this study, five types of magnetic tracers were made with fine soil, fly ash, cement, bentonite, and magnetic powder (reduced iron powder) using the method of disk granulation. The tracers were uniformly mixed with soil and tested in the laboratory using simulated rainfall and inflow experiments to simulate the interrill and rill components of soil erosion, in order to select one or more tracers which could be used to study detachment and deposition by the erosive forces of raindrops and surface flow of water on a slope. The results showed that the five types of magnetic tracers with high magnetic susceptibility and a wide range of sizes had a range of 0.99-1.29 g cm(-3) in bulk density. In the interrill and rill experiments, the tracers FC1 and FC2 which consisted of fly ash and cement at ratios of 1:1 and 2:1, respectively, were transported in phase with soil particles since the magnetic susceptibility of sediment approximated that of the soil which was uneroded and the slopes of the regression equations between the detachment of sediment and magnetic tracers FC1 and FC2 were very close to the expected value of 20, which was the original soil/tracer ratio. The detachment and deposition on slopes could be accurately reflected by the magnetic susceptibility differences. The change in magnetic susceptibility depended on whether deposition or detachment occurred. However, the tracer FS which consisted of fine soil and the tracers FBI and FB2 which consisted of fly ash and bentonite at ratios of 1:1 and 2:1, respectively, were all unsuitable for soil erosion study since there was no consistent relationship between sediment and tracer detachment for increasing amounts of runoff.

Overwintering experiments, involving five North East North American Cicindela species with spring-fall life histories-Cicindela repanda (Dejean), Cicindela hirticollis (Say), Cicindela purpurea (Olivier), Cicindela scutellaris (Say), and Cicindela tranquebarica (Herbst)-demonstrated that both a long cooldown (20 to 4 degrees C by a degree a day) and a short photoperiod (8: 16 [L: D] h) maximized survival and minimized overwintering weight loss, which varied between species and sex. Observations of oviposition, larval abundance and larval development involving five Cicindela species with summer life histories revealed that Cicindela punctulata (Olivier) produced more first-instar larvae than Cicindela abdominalis (F.), Cicindela dorsalis dorsalis (Say), Cicindela puritana (Horn), or Cicindela unipunctata (F.) and that high mortality due to accidental desiccation may be overcome by rearing larvae individually in tubes rather than in bins. We also present a first account of larval rearing of the federally threatened species C. puritana and the northern Martha's Vineyard population of the federally threatened species C. d. dorsalis. Notably, C. d. dorsalis produced fewer larvae than more common species reared in this study. We conclude that rearing large numbers of larvae is feasible with endangered as well as common species and we propose future improvements for rearing as part of conservation efforts.","Laboratory Rearing of Common and Endangered Species of North American Tiger Beetles Coleoptera Carabidae Cicindelinae","North American tiger beetles (Cicindela spp. L.) have been reared in the laboratory for more than a century, and here we summarize the relevant literature to develop a general rearing protocol.

The collection and documentation of the experimental evidence of chaos in biological populations have always been elusive. We were puzzled by the observation that the most frequently computed demographic parameter for laboratory insect populations, the population intrinsic rate of increase (r (m)), seems too small to induce chaotic dynamics. For example, when it is directly utilized as an approximation to the parameter (a) of the one-parameter discrete logistic model, the parameter seems well out of the chaotic range. In a recent reanalysis of our early laboratory demographic data of 1800 Russian wheat aphids (RWA), we discovered that a proper measure unit conversion should be performed to make the link between r (m) and the discrete logistic model. We think that this conversion issue may have been ignored historically in biological literature since we are not aware of any uses of the r (m) in the discussion of chaos. It should be noted that r (m) is different from the r in discrete logistic model (e.g., May in Nature 261:459-467, 1976). Since extensive demographic data purported to estimate r (m) have been accumulated in literature on population growth, the finding revealed with our RWA experiment data can easily be verified with the published data in literature. We near-arbitrarily surveyed 10 studies (containing 37 datasets of r (m)) published in the literature and archived in JSTOR or BioOne databases to test the conversion, and the results confirmed our finding. The finding should significantly expand the evidence base of chaos in laboratory populations of insects and possibly microorganisms, too.","Did we miss some evidence of chaos in laboratory insect populations","The collection and documentation of the experimental evidence of chaos in biological populations have always been elusive.

A model relating beetle hunger to starvation time was developed and used to calculate initial hunger for beetles used in predation observations. Hunger level was significantly correlated with the time spent searching a wheat plant and the number of aphids eaten by both male and female convergent lady beetles during a plant visit. Time since contacting (either touching or eating) an aphid was slightly negatively correlated with time the lady beetle spent searching a plant. Time since contact also was slightly negatively related to the number of aphids eaten. The mean time required to eat an aphid increased with aphid instar as was expected because of the corresponding increase in size. Female convergent lady beetles took an average of 27.0 seconds to consume a first-instar English grain aphid, with time increasing to 141.2 seconds for an apterous adult. The mean proportion of English grain aphids leaving a plant in response to foraging by lady beetles increased with aphid instar from 0.09 for first instars to 0.49 for adult alatae. The proportion of aphids leaving a plant was significantly correlated with the time a lady beetle spent searching a plant. Although we observed increased residence time and increased time adult convergent lady beetles spent searching when aphids were abundant, the predation rate was independent of the number of aphids on a plant.","Foraging by Hippodamia convergens for Cereal Aphids on Wheat Plants in the Laboratory","We investigated predation by adult convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, on the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae L., on wheat, Triticum aestivum L., plants in a laboratory arena.

To determine ecological host range of its natural enemies, surveys were conducted on C. grandiflorum and 11 other Sapindaceae at 40 sites in the weed's native range (Argentina). These surveys indicated that the seed-feeding weevil Cissoanthonomus tuberculipennis was restricted to C. grandiflorum, and that it was among the common natural enemies, occurring at most sites where C. grandiflorum was recorded. Open-field tests were conducted under natural conditions in Argentina to determine the host preference of C. tuberculipennis and other natural enemies of C. grandiflorum among three Cardiospermum species. These tests revealed that C. tuberculipennis and the bug Gargaphia sp. were restricted to C. grandiflorum though the latter subsequently developed on non-target Cardiospermum species in the laboratory. C. tuberculipennis was found to be highly damaging, destroying up to 44% of the seeds per plant in Argentina. In all the host-specificity tests, including no-choice, paired-choice and multi-choice tests, C. tuberculipennis only fed and developed on C. grandiflorum. Failure of C. tuberculipennis to feed and develop on all congeners of C. grandiflorum shows that the weevil is highly host-specific to the target weed. Results of host-specificity tests, open field tests and long-term monitoring of C. tuberculipennis populations demonstrate that the weevil poses no threat to non-target plant species, and therefore safe for release against C. grandiflorum in South Africa.

The pest has extended its distribution throughout the wheat fields of Iran and in particular the East Azarbaijan province. Five modern Iranian wheat varieties, namely Alamoot, Alvand, Zarrin, Sabalan and Sardari, which are the most extensively cultivated in the province, were used in laboratory screening tests for assessment of their antibiosis resistance to the aphid at the stem elongation growth stage. This work was carried out under greenhouse conditions of 24.2 +/- 4.5 degrees C temperature, 55.7 +/- 4.6% R.H. and 16:8 (L: D) light regime. The probable antibiosis was assessed by studying the nymphal survival rate; mean developmental time and adult fecundity (total no. of progeny/ female produced within the first 10 and 15 days of reproductive stage) calculating the relevant intrinsic rate of natural population increase (r(m) value). The ANOVA of the data indicated that regarding duration of nymphal development time, adult fecundity and also r(m) values, there were significant differences (p<0.01) between the varieties. Based on this, the highest (7.70 +/- 0.47) and lowest (5.75 +/- 0.44) mean nymphal development time was calculated on Alvand and Sabalan respectively. The greatest (59.35 +/- 2.60 & 88.15 +/- 4.81) and the least (38.30 +/- 2.20 & 58.60 +/- 3.42) numbers of progeny produced per female within the first 10 and 15 days of larviposition period was observed on Sabalan and Sardari respectively.

Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, Southern Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina, is one of 82 EF&Rs located throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Since its establishment in 1934, the wealth and breadth of scientific knowledge gained from Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory research has provided both public and private land managers information on forest land management and has added to the knowledge base of natural resource science.We described the early watershed research at Coweeta and used long-term measurements and inventories (from 1934 to 2008) to: (1) explore the influences of large-scale disturbances and vegetation responses on ecosystem processes and (2) assess the long-term and short-term impacts of an exotic, invasive species on a southern Appalachian deciduous forest. We focused on changes in vegetation patterns influenced by natural and managed disturbances and then described the linkages between long-term vegetation measurements and water yield and quality responses. For natural disturbances, we used a network of over 900 permanent vegetation plots established in reference watersheds and unmanaged areas; first measured in 1934 and a subset re-measured in 1969-1972, 1988-1993, and 2003-2008. For the managed disturbances, clearcuts and species conversion experiments, vegetation was measured in permanent plots within treated watersheds before and after treatment.By the time of the 1934 survey, the forest had only 10 years to recover from logging before chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) induced mortality of virtually all remaining Castanea dentata trees. With the loss of C dentata as the dominant species, Acer rubrum and Quercus montana became the dominant species and Liriodendron tulipifera and Tsuga canadensis increased in coves and along riparian corridors. T. canadensis is currently threatened by another invasive species, hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA, Adelges tsugae), with 33% tree mortality between 2003 and 2008. Smaller-scale disturbances, such as drought and windthrow, have created canopy gaps and the disturbance agent, gap size, and species-specific demography (dispersal, survival, growth, and mortality) affected colonization and recruitment. In general, the composition of species recruiting into canopy gaps was a reflection of the vegetation already in place at the time of disturbance, because regeneration occurred primarily through saplings or sprouts. In managed forests, where gaps were much larger (9-59 ha), early successional species recruit and become established and the long-term vegetation patterns are different than in unmanaged forests. The vegetation data provide a description of changes in forest structure and composition through time and space, and they have been used to develop process-based models to scale-up to the catchment level. Long-term climatic, hydrologic, biogeochemical, and vegetation databases coupled with process-based ecohydrology and ecophysiology models are essential to understanding broader- and more complex environmental issues such as climate change, carbon cycling, atmospheric deposition, and water supply and quality.

The vegetation data provide a description of changes in forest structure and composition through time and space, and they have been used to develop process-based models to scale-up to the catchment level. Long-term climatic, hydrologic, biogeochemical, and vegetation databases coupled with process-based ecohydrology and ecophysiology models are essential to understanding broader- and more complex environmental issues such as climate change, carbon cycling, atmospheric deposition, and water supply and quality.

The average adult longevity in artificial diet was the shortest (18.7 d), with the longest longevity observed (36.1 d) on green beans. The intrinsic rates of population increase (r(m)) were much higher in artificial diet (0.0771) and green beans (0.0671) than in alfalfa (0.0327) and cotton square (0.0317). Although statistically significant, the difference in r(m) values between alfalfa and cotton square was very small, indicating the similarity in reproductive suitability of cotton square and alfalfa in a no-choice test. Thus, even though cotton is not a preferred host, when blooming alfalfa and roadside weeds are mowed in the Texas High Plains during June-July, it is the most likely time that Lygus bugs may move from alfalfa and other host pants into adjacent cotton fields and become effective pest of actively fruiting cotton.","Development and Population Growth of Lygus hesperus on Selected Weed Hosts Artificial Diet and Cotton in the Laboratory","Laboratory studies were conducted to obtain basic biological information of Lygus hesperus Knight (Hemiptera: Miridae) on alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), pigweed (Amaranthus palmeri S.

The results showed that the developmental duration decreased with the temperature increasing from 17 degrees C to 32 degrees C. The longest duration of the generation was 70. 19 d observed at 17 degrees C, the shortest was 27. 42 d at 32 degrees C, and the relationship between developmental rates and temperatures could be simulated by the Logistic model.

However, limited information is available regarding subsampling techniques for terrestrial invertebrate samples. Therefore a novel subsampling procedure was evaluated for processing samples of terrestrial invertebrates collected using two common field techniques: pitfall and pan traps. A three-phase sorting protocol was developed for estimating abundance and taxa richness of invertebrates. First, large invertebrates and plant material were removed from the sample using a sieve with a 4 mm mesh size. Second, the sample was poured into a specially designed, gridded sampling tray, and 16 cells, comprising 25% of the sampling tray, were randomly subsampled and processed. Third, the remainder of the sample was scanned for 4-7 min to record rare taxa missed in the second phase. To compare estimated abundance and taxa richness with the true values of these variables for the samples, the remainder of each sample was processed completely. The results were analyzed relative to three sample size categories: samples with less than 250 invertebrates (low abundance samples), samples with 250-500 invertebrates (moderate abundance samples), and samples with more than 500 invertebrates (high abundance samples). The number of invertebrates estimated after subsampling eight or more cells was highly precise for all sizes and types of samples. High accuracy for moderate and high abundance samples was achieved after even as few as six subsamples. However, estimates of the number of invertebrates for low abundance samples were less reliable. The subsampling technique also adequately estimated taxa richness; on average, subsampling detected 89% of taxa found in samples. Thus, the subsampling technique provided accurate data on both the abundance and taxa richness of terrestrial invertebrate samples. Importantly, subsampling greatly decreased the time required to process samples, cutting the time per sample by up to 80%. Based on these data, this subsampling technique is recommended to minimize the time and cost of processing moderate to large samples without compromising the integrity of the data and to maximize the information extracted from large terrestrial invertebrate samples.

By introducing a male and a female R. marginata into ventilated transparent plastic boxes, we were able to observe mating behaviour, and it involved mounting and short or long conjugation of the wasps. Dissection of female wasps after the observation indicated that long conjugation is a good behavioural predictor of sperm transfer. This finding makes it possible to obtain mated females without dissecting them every time. We tested the effect of age, season, relatedness, body size and female's ovarian status on mating. Under laboratory conditions, mating success declined rapidly below and above the ages 5-20 days.

There was no nestmate discrimination, and there was no influence of male and female body size or of the ovarian state of the female on the probability of sperm transfer.","Middle aged wasps mate through most of the year without regard to body size ovarian development and nestmateship a laboratory study of the primitively eusocial wasp Ropalidia marginata","We studied the mating behaviour of the primi-tively eusocial wasp Ropalidia marginata and the factors that may influence sperm transfer. By introducing a male and a female R. marginata into ventilated transparent plastic boxes, we were able to observe mating behaviour, and it involved mounting and short or long conjugation of the wasps. Dissection of female wasps after the observation indicated that long conjugation is a good behavioural predictor of sperm transfer. This finding makes it possible to obtain mated females without dissecting them every time. We tested the effect of age, season, relatedness, body size and female's ovarian status on mating. Under laboratory conditions, mating success declined rapidly below and above the ages 5-20 days. Within this age range mating success was significantly low in December compared to other months tested. There was no nestmate discrimination, and there was no influence of male and female body size or of the ovarian state of the female on the probability of sperm transfer.","mating behavior, nestmate discrimination, behavioral predictor, eusocial species, nestmateship","","Article","Sen, R.

This pest survives in Moroccan forests Argania spinosa and continually invades the nearest agricultural areas. Entomopathogenic fungi are an interesting tool for fruit fly control and hold a useful alternative to conventional insecticides. However, primary selection of effective pathogens should be taken in laboratory condition prior to applying them in the field. Here, we used third late instar larvae of C. capitata to investigate the effectiveness of 15 local Beauveria bassiana isolates. Results showed that all isolates were able to infect the larval stage, producing a large mortality rate in puparia ranging from 65 to 95 % and caused significant reduction in adult emergence. The fungal treatments revealed that the mycosis occurred also in adults escaping infection as pupariating larvae. The percentage of mycosed puparia was highest in strain TAM6.2 (95 %) followed by ERS4.16 (90 %), therefore they were the most virulent. Median lethal concentration (LC50) was studied for five isolates at four concentrations ranging from 10(5) to 10(8) conidia ml(-1). The results showed that the slopes of regression lines for B. bassiana ERS4.16 (slope = 0.386) and TAM6.2 (slope = 0.41) were the most important and had the lowest LC50 values (2.85 x 10(3) and 3.16 x 10(3) conidia ml(-1) respectively). This investigation suggests that the soil of Argan forests contains pathogenic B. bassiana isolates and highlights for the first time their potential as biological control toward C. capitata larval stage in Morocco.","Pathogenicity of Beauveria bassiana isolated from Moroccan Argan forests soil against larvae of Ceratitis capitata Diptera Tephritidae in laboratory conditions","The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann (Diptera: Tephritidae), is the major tephritid pest in Morocco.

During a year, housefly experiences serial population bottlenecks resulted in reduction of genetic diversity. Population structure has also been subjected to different selection regimes created by insect control programs and pest management. Both environmental and genetic disturbances can affect developmental stability, which is often reflected in morphological traits as asymmetry. Since developmental stability is of great adaptive importance, the aim of this study was to examine fluctuating asymmetry (FA), as a measure of developmental instability, in both wild populations and laboratory colonies of M. domestica. The amount and pattern of wing shape FA was compared among samples within each of two groups (laboratory and wild) and between groups. Firstly, the amount of FA does not differ significantly among samples within the group and neither does it differ between groups. Regarding the mean shape of FA, contrary to non-significant difference within the wild population group and among some colonies, the significant difference between groups was found. These results suggest that the laboratory colonies and wild samples differ in buffering mechanisms to perturbations during development. Hence, inbreeding and stochastic processes, mechanisms dominating in the laboratory-bred samples contributed to significant changes in FA of wing shape. Secondly, general patterns of left-right displacements of landmarks across both studied sample groups are consistent. Observed consistent direction of FA implies high degrees of wing integration. Thus, our findings shed light on developmental buffering processes important for population persistence in the environmental change and genetic stress influence on M. domestica.","Phenotypic variation of the housefly Musca domestica amounts and patterns of wing shape asymmetry in wild populations and laboratory colonies","Musca domestica L.

We conducted three types of 5-day laboratory experiment in which 1, 5 and 15 species of seeds of agricultural crops commonly consumed by the beetle within the Ukrainian part of its range were offered. The H. rufipes imagines were kept in plastic containers and the changes in weight of the food and changes in weight of the imagines were measured. When beetles were offered only one type of food the average consumption was 52.9 +/- 24.9 mg/day per specimen for the seeds of Fagopyrum esculentum Moench, 40.6 +/- 12.9 for Beta vulgaris L. and 40.8 +/- 124.8 mg/day per specimen for Helianthus annuus L. Significant amounts (19.1-34.0 mg/day per specimen) of other seeds offered were consumed. The least consumed were Hordeum vulgare L. (10.0 +/- 4.5 mg/day per specimen), Secale cereale L.

However, this requires developing a methodology for ecological risk assessment; which was the aim of the SEDIGEST research program. In the present study, we report the results of toxicological impacts of three sediments on aquatic ecosystems close to a quarry. These results were used to formulate a risk assessment methodology.Materials and methods The ecotoxicological approach was based on laboratory microcosm assays applied to leachates obtained from the sediments. The microcosms contained synthetic water and sediment and five pelagic (micro-algae, duckweeds and daphnids) and benthic (chironomids and amphipods) freshwater species. The biota were exposed for 3 weeks to a range of leachate concentrations; metals were monitored in the water column and the effects (i.e. mortality, growth inhibition and midge emergence) were measured.Results and discussion The results showed an absence of acute toxicity at concentrations of <10% (v/v) but sublethal effects for concentrations between 1 and 10%. Given the complex nature of the leachates, it was difficult to determine the factors of toxicity. Metals, especially Cu, might have been responsible for some of the effects on the amphipods.Conclusions Future quarries filled with seaport sediments might emit pollutants to aquatic ecosystems in their vicinity, and risk assessors should ensure that predicted environmental concentrations of leachates are below the maximum leachate concentration acceptable for the whole ecosystem; for example, by multiplying the concentration safe for the microcosm organisms by a factor of 10.","Ecotoxicological risk assessment of a quarry filling with seaport sediments using laboratory freshwater aquatic microcosms","Purpose In France, contaminated seaport sediments cannot be discharged into the sea according to recent regulation.

The blowfly has been reported in several South-American countries including Colombia, in high-altitude regions ranging from 1200 to 3100 m above sea level. The present study reports this blowfly's life cycle and an analysis of its reproductive and population parameters under laboratory conditions for the first time. Six successive generations of flies were produced with an average of 65.38% adults emerging with respect to the total number of puparia. The shortest life cycle from egg to adult emergence was found in individuals fed on a lyophilised liver (LL) diet, while the longest one was found in individuals fed with an egg-powdered milk (E-PM) diet; intermediate values were found when the pig liver (PL) diet was tested. The greatest adult longevity was achieved when the PL diet was used, the LL diet giving the shortest. The population parameters based on the horizontal life table were: net reproductive rate (R-o) = 447.752 +/- 9.9, mean generational time (T-c) = 18.18 + 0.38, natural population increase rate (r(m)) = 0.145 and finite population increase rate (lambda) = 1.398.

The population parameters based on the horizontal life table were: net reproductive rate (R-o) = 447.752 +/- 9.9, mean generational time (T-c) = 18.18 + 0.38, natural population increase rate (r(m)) = 0.145 and finite population increase rate (lambda) = 1.398. This blowfly colony represents a valuable asset for both basic and applied studies. Members of the S. magellanica colony so established were used for analysing the life-cycle, reproductive and population parameters, and further medical and forensic application studies are currently underway.

This lack of effective laboratory-rearing methods has not only hindered research into its biology and ecology, but also mass production of natural enemies for biological control of this invasive pest. Using sticks from the alternate host plant, Fraxinus uhdei (Wenzig) Lingelsh, we characterized the stage-specific development time and growth rate of both emerald ash borer eggs and larvae at different constant temperatures (12-35 degrees C) for the purpose of developing effective laboratory-rearing methods. Results from our study showed that the median time for egg hatching decreased from 20 d at 20 degrees C to 7 d at 35 degrees C, while no emerald ash borer eggs hatched at 12 degrees C. The developmental time for 50% of emerald ash borer larvae advancing to third, fourth, and J-larval stages at 20 degrees C were 8.3, 9.1, and 12.3 wk, respectively, approximately two times longer than at 30 degrees C for the corresponding instars or stages. In contrast to 30 degrees C, however, the development times of emerald ash borer larvae advancing to later instars (from oviposition) were significantly increased at 35 degrees C, indicating adverse effects of this high temperature. The optimal range of ambient temperature to rear emerald ash borer larvae should be between 25-30 degrees C; however, faster rate of egg and larval development should be expected as temperature increases within this range.","Effects of Ambient Temperature on Egg and Larval Development of the Invasive Emerald Ash Borer Coleoptera Buprestidae Implications for Laboratory Rearing","The emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, an invasive beetle from Asia causing large scale ash (Fraxinus) mortality in North America, has been extremely difficult to rear in the laboratory because of its long life cycle and cryptic nature of immature stages.

Life table parameters of aphidophagous midge, Aphidoletes aphidimyza Rondani (Dip., Cecidomyiidae) on different densities (5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80) of third instar nymphs of Aphis craccivora Koch as prey, were studiedat (25 +/- 1 degrees C, 70 +/- 5% relative humidity (RH) and a photoperiod of 16L : 8D h). There were no significant differences among the adult pre-ovipositional periods (APOP) at different prey densities. The total pre-ovipositional period (TPOP) of female A. aphidimyza was reduced significantly as prey density increased. The oviposition period was significantly different at varying prey densities. It was 4.333 +/- 0.211 and 5.625 +/- 0.324 days at the lowest and highest prey densities, respectively. Female longevity was also significantly different at varying prey densities. Fecundity was directly dependent on prey density (R-2 = 0.990). The lowest fecundity was obtained at a density of 5 prey (52.5 +/- 1.544 eggs) and the highest was at a density of 80 prey, per day (121.375 +/- 4.301 eggs). The intrinsic rate of increase (r) was prey density dependent (R-2 = 0.958), and ranged from 0.122 +/- 0.017 to 0.193 +/- 0.014 d(-1) as prey density increased. The net reproductive rate (R-0) was significantly increased as prey density increased. The peak reproductive values showed that female aphidophagous midges at the age of 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 days made the highest contribution to the population at different prey densities.

As one of the reasons for this phenomenon, migration of mated females into the Confuser V treated area were considered. Thus, we studied the flight ability of female A. nigrisigna by using computer-interfaced actograph and flight mill devices. Flight measurements for mated and unmated individuals 4- to 6-d-old were recorded for 24 h. The results of the actograph assay revealed that mated females moved more actively than unmated females, possibly because of their oviposition behavior. Both the flight duration and flight range, which were measured by the flight mill device, decreased continuously with age and did not show a significant difference between mated and unmated females through the ages from 4 to 6 d. This result indicates that mating status did not directly affect the flight duration or range. From our experiments, it was suggested that females maintain physical energy after mating at the same level as before mating and then mated females locomote more actively around the host plants for oviposition.

Besides, we evaluated how the community responds to the removal of grazing. Given that grassland streams are exposed to higher light intensity and grazers are more abundant compared to afforested streams, we proposed that if biofilm grown in the afforested stream are dominated by grazing-vulnerable algal species, grazing pressure by Helicopsyche sp. should be stronger. In addition, if biofilm from the afforested stream has low quality or is less abundant as food for consumers, the effects of Helicopsyche sp. may be stronger or weaker depending on their feeding decisions. Helicopsyche sp. caused a decrease in richness and diversity in periphyton grown in the grassland stream and its net grazing effect on chlorophyll a (Chl a) was higher. Algal community composition from grassland stream was strongly changed after grazing, with a decrease in the proportion of overstory algae. In contrast, algal community structure of periphyton from the afforested stream was neither affected by grazing nor by grazing exclusion.

The impact of two temperature and photoperiod regimes (26 degrees C, L16:D8 h; 21 degrees C, L8:D16 h) on the life table of O. sauteri was studied in the laboratory using an age-stage, two-sex life-table method. The results showed that the low-temperature short-photoperiod regime resulted in significant increases of the developmental times of the egg, the first to fifth nymphal stages, and the total preadult stage. Female adult longevity was significantly increased, whereas male adult longevity was significantly decreased, under this regime. Furthermore, the adult preoviposition period (APOP), the total preoviposition period (TPOP), and the sex ratio were all increased under this regime. Fecundity decreased, whereas the mean generation time (7) increased, as temperature and photoperiod decreased. The intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (2,.), and net reproductive rate (R-o) all increased as the temperature decreased under diapause induction. Based on the estimated data, the higher r value (0.06 d(-1)) occurred under the 26 degrees C, L16:D8 h regime, compared with 0.03 d(-1), under the 21 degrees C, L8:D16 h regime. Thus, the results showed that reproductive diapause slowed O. sauteri population growth, about 50% reduction based on r. There is significant interest in using O. sawed as a biological control agent against non-diapausing small pests, such as thrips, in greenhouses under short photo periods. However, based on the current results, managers should consider maintaining a high temperature and long photoperiod to prevent reproductive diapause induction in 0. sauteri.

Such conditions should not have a detrimental effect on the greenhouse crops.","reproductive rate , sex life table","","Article","Sun, Meng; Lu, Bing; Lyu, Zhao-yun; Zhang, Yang; Zhai, Yi-fan; Chen, Hao; Zheng, Li (zhengli64@126.com) ; Yu, Yi","Zheng, Li; Shandong Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Beneficial Insects Res Ctr, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China","Journal of Asia-Pacific Entomology","2017","20","4","1301","1306","10.1016/j.aspen.2017.09.005","English","WoS_BIOSIS_CitIndex"

Tests were performed under multiple-choice and no-choice conditions to evaluate the biological characteristics of H. armigera. In addition, the biological data obtained were used to determine parameters of fertility life tables. The results showed that H. armigera does not have a feeding preference among the sunflower genotypes tested. The larval period on sunflower ranged from 15.0 to 16.2 days. The maximum fecundity on sunflower was 542.6 eggs/female and that on the artificial diet was 794.5 eggs/female. In general, insects feeding on Helio 250 consumed greater quantities of leaves, had higher survival until the end of the pupal stage, displayed high population growth rates, and had low population doubling times, suggesting that in the field populations will achieve greater population densities when fed on Helio 250. Insects that fed on CF101 consumed smaller leaf areas, had lower survival until the end of the pupal stage, lower fertility rates, and lower population growth rates, and may also have displayed lower population densities and smaller reductions in field productivity.

However, no sequence information is available regarding Hb genes in Propsilocerus akamusi (Tolcunaga), thus the change in Hb mRNA gene expression caused by environmental pollutants remains unknown. In this study, we cloned two Hb gene fragments (PaHbV and PaHbVII) from P. akamusi, analyzed the expression patterns of the PaHbV and PaHbVII transcripts in different tissues using Real-Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and also measured the Cd levels in different tissues exposed to a sublethal concentration. The results showed significantly increased Cd concentrations and tissue-specific Cd distribution patterns in all of the tissues tested, including the hemolymph, during all time courses. A model describing the roles of specific tissues in Cd uptake and accumulation dynamics was also determined. The Malpighian tubules, gut, and epidermis were the primary sites of Cd accumulation, whereas the hemolymph was the temporary target organ of Cd accumulation, with the Cd being transferred to other internal tissues via the hemolymph. The relative mRNA expression profiles of PaHbV and PaHbVII indicated that their expression levels differed across the different tissues, indicating a tissue-specific response. Our results suggested a reverse effect between Hb expression and Cd accumulation during long-term Cd exposure in comparison with previous studies. The expressions of Hb genes in P. akamusi could be developed as biomarkers for assessing the general health conditions of freshwater ecosystems.","Cadmium exposure on tissue-specific cadmium accumulation and alteration of hemoglobin expression in the 4th-instar larvae of Propsilocerus akamusi Tokunaga under laboratory conditions","The expression of hemoglobin (Hb) genes has considerable potential as a biomarker for environmental monitoring in Chironomus.

The aims were to determine the type and other characteristics of functional response including predatory capacity of green lacewing for possible use in augmentative biological control in apple (Malus x domestica Borkh; Rosales: Rosaceae) orchards where obliquebanded leafroller was recently introduced in Mexico. Abundance of the pest increased rapidly, causing significant foliar damage and some fruit blemish. Third-instar green lacewing larvae based on logistic regression analysis showed Type II functional response to four densities of single-instar larvae of obliquebanded leafroller. Among the five instars of prey, the largest average number consumed per green lacewing predator was a relative density of four second-instar larvae at a rate of 1.93 in 24 hours. Also, substantial average consumption was by two third-instar prey larvae per predator whereby an average of 1.5 third-instar obliquebanded leafrollers were consumed per third-instar green lacewing in 24 hours. The third-instar predator captured and consumed third-instar prey larvae in the shortest handling time (h), i.e., only 6.46 minutes, whereas the handling times for the other instars ranged from 23.48 minutes for the fifth instar to 31.56 minutes for the fourth instar. However, attack coefficients (a) of green lacewings were slightly greater for third-and fourth-instar prey larvae, with 0.19 hour (11.4 minutes) and 0.15 hour (9.0 minutes) until the first attack, respectively, compared to 0.09-0.11 hour (5.4-6.6 minutes) until the first attack for the other instars.

Empirical studies of the effect of phenotypic diversity on colony fitness mostly focused on species with discrete castes (workers, soldiers) or with continuously and highly morphologically variable workers, which is not the most common case. Indeed, most species exhibit continuous but limited worker morphological variation. It is still unclear whether this variation impacts colony fitness. To test this, we reduced the worker size diversity in 25 colonies of the ant Temnothorax nylanderi and compared their performances to 25 control colonies. We reared these colonies in the laboratory and measured the effect of treatment (reduced diversity or control) and colony size (number of workers) on colony performance at six challenges, as well as on worker mortality and brood production. The reduction of worker size diversity did not affect colony performance nor mortality and brood production. As expected, colony performance and brood production increased with colony size. These results suggest that worker size diversity may not be under positive selection in this species, but rather the product of a lack of developmental canalization. We propose that social life could decrease the selective pressures maintaining developmental canalization, subsequently leading to higher size diversity without necessarily increasing colony performance.Significance statementIn social insects, nestmate size diversity is commonly thought to improve division of labour and colony performance. This has been clearly demonstrated in species with high size diversity, either discrete or continuous, but this is unclear in most of the social insects that exhibit low size diversity. We experimentally decreased worker size diversity in the ant Temnothorax nylanderi, a species with low worker size diversity. Reducing worker size diversity had no effect on colony performance, worker mortality, or brood production. Our findings support the hypothesis that low size diversity is merely the product of developmental noise and is not necessarily adaptive. We propose that social life could relax the selective pressures maintaining developmental and social canalizations, subsequently leading to size diversity.","Decreasing worker size diversity does not affect colony performance during laboratory challenges in the ant Temnothorax nylanderi","Within-colony phenotypic diversity can play an essential role in some eusocial insect taxa by increasing the performance of division of labor, thereby increasing colony fitness.

Such effects may be profound following a range expansion, when males from a new species may suddenly encounter (and perhaps even become abundant relative to) females of related native species. Drosophila subobscura recently invaded North America and may impact native species through reproductive interference and other processes. We test for the potential for reproductive interference by D. subobscura males on D. persimilis females in the laboratory. D. subobscura males aggressively copulated with D. persimilis females, including many females that exhibit rejection behaviors. Despite females attempting to dismount the males, the heterospecific copulations are on average longer than conspecific copulations, and females exhibit some reluctance to remate with conspecific males following this harassment. Females confined with both conspecific and heterospecific males produce fewer adult progeny than those with either conspecific males only or with conspecific males and distantly related D. simulans males that do not engage in female harassment. Overall, our results illustrate how reproductive interference by an invasive species can have negative effects on resident natural populations.","Reproductive interference by male Drosophila subobscura on female D persimilis A laboratory experiment","While females often reject courtship attempts by heterospecific males, reproductive interference by harassment from such males can nonetheless occur, potentially reducing female fitness. Such effects may be profound following a range expansion, when males from a new species may suddenly encounter (and perhaps even become abundant relative to) females of related native species. Drosophila subobscura recently invaded North America and may impact native species through reproductive interference and other processes.

Adult spruce bark beetles are well-adapted to survive over winter however, the ability of sub-adult stages to overwinter has not been clearly established. The increase in average temperature recorded over the last three decades has resulted in an increase in voltinism by one generation, but due to insufficient time the last generation may not complete its development. It is crucial to investigate the survival and development of sub-adult stages at low temperatures in order to predict the effect of increased voltinism on the population dynamics of this species. We measured the development and survival of larvae and pupae (over 12 weeks) in logs kept at winter temperatures outdoors (in shade and exposed to sunlight) and in the laboratory (at 0 and 5 degrees C), with 10 degrees C as a control, at which normal development was expected. Overall, findings revealed that development continued at low temperatures, although it was slower than at high temperatures. Importantly, after 12 weeks significant numbers of spruce bark beetles were present, including newly emerged adults. We demonstrate, for the first time, that sub-adult spruce bark beetles can mature over winter and the percentage survival was significant, indicating that some of the beetles that did not complete their development before the onset of winter can complete their development during winter and potentially adversely affect forests and pose problems for their management.","Development and survival of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus Coleoptera Curculionidae Scolytinae at low temperatures in the laboratory and the field","The European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) is a highly destructive pest of spruce monocultures.

Testing of 12 candidate plants under laboratory conditions Intercropping of companion plants (CPs) that release distinct volatile compounds with horticultural crops has been proposed to improve pest management. Although CP extracts or essential oils have been reported to be efficient in disturbing the settling of insects such as aphids, the effect of using actual CPs remains relatively unknown. Our aim was to screen odorous CP species for their effect on the performance of green peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae), when released on adjacent pepper plants. Intercropping was tested in growth chambers using potted plants to avoid root interactions and homogenise the abiotic environment of CPs. Our results indicated that eight CP species-rosemary, African marigold, French marigold, geranium, lavender, basil, chives, and pot marigold-affected aphid performance by reducing the reproductive performance and/or settlement of females. Rosemary followed by African and French marigold was associated with the largest reduction in adult female and nymph number. Chemical analyses indicated that rosemary and French marigold emit specific volatiles. In contrast, four CP species (false yellowhead, thyme, savoury, and peppermint) were not associated with a significant change in aphid performance and emitted a lower diversity of volatiles. This screening of CPs under controlled conditions may be considered as a first step towards the identification of volatiles emitted by actual plants that can affect aphid performance and help the choice of CPs to optimise intercropping strategies.","Which companion plants affect the performance of green peach aphid on host plants Testing of 12 candidate plants under laboratory conditions","Intercropping of companion plants (CPs) that release distinct volatile compounds with horticultural crops has been proposed to improve pest management.

However, limited data are available on egg production as related to larval rearing conditions. Because Ae. albopictus is a container-inhabiting mosquito that oviposits in resource-limited habitats, it is found under variable density-dependent conditions. Therefore, we examined the impact of specific rearing conditions on Ae. albopictus clutch size and adult body size; comparing the egg production values and wing lengths from known developmental densities to those from field-collected populations. Field populations varied significantly among collection sites in mean clutch size (23 to 46). These clutch sizes were comparable to the mean clutch sizes of females reared at the larval densities of nine (20 eggs) and three (53 eggs) larvae per 3 ml of water in the laboratory. Field populations experienced density-dependent effects impacting adult mosquito size. Mosquitoes from the four sample sites had mean wing lengths of 1.99, 2.47, 2.51, and 2.54 mm, which were less than the mean wing length of mosquitoes reared at larval densities of three larvae per 3 ml of water (2.57 mm).","Assessment of Aedes albopictus Skuse Diptera Culicidae clutch size in wild and laboratory populations","Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is an invasive mosquito species found across the southern U.S. with range expansion into many northern states.

Despite this, little is known with regard to the reproductive behavior of this insect. In the present study, we investigated the circadian rhythm of adult eclosion, mating and oviposition under laboratory conditions. The age at which moths mate and the frequency and duration of mating bouts were recorded. Eclosion and mating behavior were limited to nocturnal hours. Male and female eclosion peaked between 3 and 4 h, and between 4.5 and 5.5 h after the initiation of scotophase, respectively. Mating behavior peaked between 10 and 11.5 h after the initiation of scotophase. Most ovipositions occurred during the scotophase, displaying one distinct peak between 3 and 3.5 h after the initiation of scotophase. More than 70 % of matings occurred on the first scotophase after adult eclosion and the percentage of successful matings declined dramatically with moth age, indicating age was an important factor in the mating success of this species. If males or females paired with newly ecloced virgin partners after each successful mating, 57.6 % of males and 24.2 % of females mated more than once, mating an average of 2.0 +/- A 0.2 and 1.3 +/- A 0.1 times, respectively, suggesting males are generally polygynous, while females are monandrous. The copulation duration of this moth lasted on average 16.6 +/- A 0.1 h and was not influenced by moth age and female mating frequency, but was negatively influenced by male mating frequency. These data provide basic information to further study the mating system of D. punctatus, and could lead to the development of behavior-based pest control strategies of this species.","Reproductive behavior of the masson pine caterpillar Dendrolimus punctatus Lepidoptera Lasiocampidae under laboratory conditions","The pine caterpillar, Dendrolimus punctatus Walker (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae), is one of the most serious defoliators of pine trees (Pinus spp.) in China.

Laboratory experiments have demonstrated how oxygen limitation can set heat tolerance for some aquatic ectotherms, but only at unrealistic lethal temperatures and without field data to assess whether oxygen shortages might also underlie sublethal warming effects. Here, we test whether oxygen availability affects both lethal and nonlethal impacts of warming on two widespread Eurasian mayflies, Ephemera danica, Muller 1764 and Serratella ignita (Poda 1761). Mayfly nymphs are often a dominant component of the invertebrate assemblage in streams, and play a vital role in aquatic and riparian food webs. In the laboratory, lethal impacts of warming were assessed under three oxygen conditions. In the field, effects of oxygen availability on nonlethal impacts of warming were assessed from mayfly occurrence in 42293 UK stream samples where water temperature and biochemical oxygen demand were measured. Oxygen limitation affected both lethal and sublethal impacts of warming in each species. Hypoxia lowered lethal limits by 5.5 degrees C (+/- 2.13) and 8.2 degrees C (+/- 0.62) for E.danica and S.ignita respectively. Field data confirmed the importance of oxygen limitation in warmer waters; poor oxygenation drastically reduced site occupancy, and reductions were especially pronounced under warm water conditions. Consequently, poor oxygenation lowered optimal stream temperatures for both species. The broad concordance shown here between laboratory results and extensive field data suggests that oxygen limitation not only impairs survival at thermal extremes but also restricts species abundance in the field at temperatures well below upper lethal limits. Stream oxygenation could thus control the vulnerability of aquatic ectotherms to global warming. Improving water oxygenation and reducing pollution can provide key facets of climate change adaptation for running waters.","Field and laboratory studies reveal interacting effects of stream oxygenation and warming on aquatic ectotherms","Aquatic ecological responses to climatic warming are complicated by interactions between thermal effects and other environmental stressors such as organic pollution and hypoxia.

Although laboratory trials report deleterious effects in honeybees at trace levels, field surveys reveal no decrease in the performance of honeybee colonies in the vicinity of treated fields. Here we provide the missing link, showing that individual honeybees near thiamethoxam-treated fields do indeed disappear at a faster rate, but the impact of this is buffered by the colonies' demographic regulation response. Although we could ascertain the exposure pathway of thiamethoxam residues from treated flowers to honeybee dietary nectar, we uncovered an unexpected pervasive co-occurrence of similar concentrations of imidacloprid, another neonicotinoid normally restricted to non-entomophilous crops in the study country. Thus, its origin and transfer pathways through the succession of annual crops need be elucidated to conveniently appraise the risks of combined neonicotinoid exposures. This study reconciles the conflicting laboratory and field toxicity assessments of neonicotinoids on honeybees and further highlights the difficulty in actually detecting non-intentional effects on the field through conventional risk assessment methods.","Reconciling laboratory and field assessments of neonicotinoid toxicity to honeybees","European governments have banned the use of three common neonicotinoid pesticides due to insufficiently identified risks to bees.

Mating compatibility tests were undertaken under standardised semi-natural conditions, with number of homo/heterotypic couples and mating location in field cages analysed via compatibility indices. Central and southern populations of B. dorsalis displayed positive assortative mating in the 2010 trials but mated randomly in the 2011 trials. 'Wildish' southern Thailand males mated significantly earlier than central Thailand males in 2010; this difference was considerably reduced in 2011, yet homotypic couples from southern Thailand still formed significantly earlier than all other couple combinations. There was no significant difference in couple location in 2010; however, couple location significantly differed among pair types in 2011 with those involving southern Thailand females occurring significantly more often on the tree relative to those with central Thailand females. Relative participation also changed with time, with more southern Thailand females forming couples relative to central Thailand females in 2010; this difference was considerably decreased by 2011. These results reveal how subtle changes in sexual behaviour, as driven by laboratory rearing conditions, may significantly influence mating behaviour between laboratory-adapted and recently colonised tephritid fruit flies over a relatively short period of time.","Effects of laboratory colonization on Bactrocera dorsalis Diptera Tephritidae mating behaviour 'what a difference a year makes'","Laboratory-reared insects are widely known to have significantly reduced genetic diversity in comparison to wild populations; however, subtle behavioural changes between laboratory-adapted and wild or 'wildish' (i.e., within one or very few generations of field collected material) populations are less well understood.

These results reveal how subtle changes in sexual behaviour, as driven by laboratory rearing conditions, may significantly influence mating behaviour between laboratory-adapted and recently colonised tephritid fruit flies over a relatively short period of time.","sexual behavior, mating behavior, assortative mating, laboratory rearing condition, integrative taxonomic research","mating compatibility test; laboratory techniques","Article","Schutze, Mark K.

Live and dead insects and stages of development; the onset and duration of the pre-reproductive, reproductive and post-reproductive periods; the number of nymphs per female; and the longevity of the adults were quantified daily. Based on these observations, fertility life expectancy tables were developed, and the thermal requirements of the cowpea black-aphid were determined. Increased temperature influenced all stages of insect development, as well as the pre-reproductive and post-reproductive periods and the total number of nymphs per female. The base temperature for development was 9.13 degrees C with thermal development constant of 99.0 GD. The highest net reproduction rate (Ro) was at 25 degrees C. At 28 degrees C, the greatest capacity to increase in number (r(m)) was observed, as well as the highest finite rate of increase (lambda) and the shortest time to double in number (TD).

The use of native fish for mosquito control may have benefits for both aquatic biodiversity and human health. Evaluating the effect of vegetation on the predatory efficacy is fundamental to determine if this species can be used as a biocontrol agent. With the aim of evaluating Jenynsia multidentata (Jenyns, 1842) as a biocontrol agent of Culex pipiens Linnaeus, 1758, we tested its predatory capacity in the presence or absence of aquatic vegetation under laboratory conditions. Two independent experiments were conducted. Larval consumption at a density of 60 larvae (6 larvae/l) was significantly reduced with the vegetation increased. On the other hand, when the larval density was 120 (12 larvae/l), the predatory capacity of J. multidentata did not vary in the presence or absence of vegetation. This result indicated that vegetation effect on consumption could be related to prey density, since at the higher density of prey the probability of predator-prey encounter might be increased. Jenynsia multidentata is a good consumer in presence of vegetation and could be used as a potential biocontrol agent of mosquito larvae in natural environments with similar characteristics to the ones tested in these experiments.","Assessment of the predatory capacity on mosquito larvae of Jenynsia multidentata Anablepidae in presence of vegetation under laboratory conditions","Larvivorous fish have been studied as potential biocontrol agents of mosquito larvae and pupae through their trophic interactions.

We compared the field effects to those observed in single-species laboratory tests employing the hemiedaphic collembolan Folsomia candida and the epedaphic Sinella curviseta obtained from laboratory cultures and exposed to field-collected polluted soil. The results indicated that different collembolan species responded differently to the pollution in the fields and could be divided into sensitive, indifferent, and tolerant types accordingly. The abundance of sensitive species decreased as the pollution increased, but this was not the same for indifferent and tolerant species. The dominant species changed from sensitive to tolerant species as the pollution increased. The reproduction of F. candida and S. curviseta was most sensitive to the contaminated soil compared to growth and survival; the sensitivity of the two species was similar. The growth was more sensitive than the survival for F. candida but not for S. curviseta. The growth and survival of F. candida were much more sensitive than those of S. curviseta. Sensitivity of field populations of F. candida (EC10 31 [15-46]) and hemiedaphic species Folsomia quadrioculata (EC10 52 [0.7-102]) were comparable with sensitivity of the reproduction of F. candida in the single-species tests (EC10 21 [14-27]), suggesting that single-species test based on laboratory cultures and field soil could be used to link laboratory and field data and then reflect the field situation.

Here, its increasing abundance and the ability to actively prey on a keystone sea urchin species suggest potential repercussions for the structure and functioning of benthic communities. We performed laboratory feeding experiments to investigate interactions between Mediterranean H. carunculata and 12 species of sessile or sedentary invertebrates. H. carunculata preyed efficiently on 9 of the species offered. In particular, active predation of a polychaete upon nudibranchs, colonial ascidians and chitons was reported for the first time. Fireworms' predatory ability may be due to a combination of several weapons' (large size, motility, stinging chaetae and eversible, sucking pharynx) which seems to be unique among marine worms, and could enable H. carunculata to persist also after radical changes in prey community composition and withstand selective pressures associated with ongoing environmental changes.","Laboratory observations on predator-prey interactions between the bearded fireworm Hermodice carunculata and Mediterranean benthic invertebrates","The bearded fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) is an amphinomid polychaete with a circumtropical Atlantic-Mediterranean distribution.

Field studies were conducted with glyphosate and the insecticide endosulfan to observe the effects of these pesticides on C. arcuata, on its damages in the crop and on the populations of natural enemies in glyphosate-resistant soybean crops. Moreover, the lethal and behavioral sublethal response of C. arcuata to glyphosate and endosulfan was conducted in the laboratory. The results of the field and laboratory experiments showed that glyphosate caused moderate toxicity and high irritability in C. arcuata and that endosulfan caused high toxicity and irritability. Therefore, the direct effect of glyphosate on C. arcuata was negative and does not explain the population increases of this pest in glyphosate-resistant soybean. However, the glyphosate also decreased the density of predators. Thus, the negative effect of glyphosate on the predators may be related to population increases of C. arcuata in glyphosate-resistant soybean crops, however, more studies are needed to better evidence this relationship. This study suggests that glyphosate can impact other nontarget organisms, such as herbivorous insects and natural enemies and that the use of this herbicide will need to be carefully stewarded to prevent potential disturbances in beneficial insect communities in agricultural systems.","Effects of glyphosate on the non-target leaf beetle Cerotoma arcuata Coleoptera Chrysornelidae in field and laboratory conditions","This study aimed to assess the glyphosate application effects on the Cerotoma arcuata Oliver (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) population in glyphosate-resistant soybean crops.

Results confirmed that the age at which the male pupa is irradiated is an important factor that affects the longevity of the adult, whereas the effect of age on the induced sterility level is less pronounced. When male pupae older than 30 h were irradiated, the longevity of the adults was not affected by doses up to 40 Gy.

Adult pairs were monitored in no-choice laboratory assays for the duration of their lifespans on basswood, Tilia americana, ironwood, Ostrya virginiana, sugar maple, Acer saccharum, raspberry, Rubus spp., or leatherwood, Dirca palustris. Overall, P. sericeus lived more than twice as long as P. oblongus and lived longer on all hosts. P. sericeus consumed more total leaf area than P. oblongus on basswood, ironwood, and raspberry, but P. oblongus had a higher leaf consumption rate on sugar maple. Basswood was a very good host for P. sericeus. Leatherwood was not a suitable host for either weevil species. The higher longevity and fecundity of P. sericeus than P. oblongus did not agree with that expected from population data, in that the latter species is substantially more abundant. This likely reflects P. oblongus' superior performance on sugar maple, the dominant flora in the study area.

The second was that wild female flies had difficulty ovipositing in an artificial substrate, yielding the lowest fecundity rates observed throughout the experiment. The third significant change was a decrease in longevity and life expectancy from Gp to G1, which then continued to decrease with successive generations.

Experiments were conducted at two densities of Hydropsyche high (300 per tank) and low (80 per tank). Brachycentrus density was kept constant at 40 per tank in all experiments. Experiments assessed the effect of an agricultural pollutant mix (sand, cow-manure compost mix) and the presence of the competitor on both taxa. 4. The only negative response to pollutants was a larger number of Hydropsyche drifting in high-density tanks. In fact, at high densities, mortality of Hydropsyche was higher in controls than in tanks receiving pollutants. 5. Hydropsyche and B. appalachia competed for resources and the presence of pollution did not affect the outcome of this competition. The presence of high densities of Hydropsyche resulted in higher drift and lower condition of B. appalachia. At low densities of Hydropsyche, B. appalachia larvae suffered greater mortality and tended to be in poorer condition. Brachycentrus appalachia may be less successful at even moderate densities of Hydropsyche due to competition between these taxa, most likely for prime feeding positions. 6. Streams receiving non-point source pollution from agriculture may be able to support higher densities of Hydropsyche, which may further reduce the suitability of these habitats for B. appalachia. 7. This experimental study suggests that competition may complicate interpretation of biotic indices, as changes in benthic invertebrate community structure normally ascribed to pollution may arise from intra-specific competition.","Do agricultural pollutants affect competition between filter-feeding caddis fly larvae Results of laboratory microcosm experiments electronic resource","1.

We also wanted to determine the minimum number of individuals needed to establish a vital colony. As a result, every colony beginning with less than 20 workers died within 60 weeks, while colonies beginning with at least 20 workers survived until the end of the tests, with varied survival rates dependent upon the initial size and the time of formation (summer or autumn). The number of nymphs did not affect colony survival and colony growth. Reproductives developed from nymphs within 2 weeks and later from workers. Many of the reproductives derived from nymphs were killed by workers. The majority of the colonies contained two reproductives 3 years after initiating the tests.

We also wanted to determine the minimum number of individuals needed to establish a vital colony. As a result, every colony beginning with less than 20 workers died within 60 weeks, while colonies beginning with at least 20 workers survived until the end of the tests, with varied survival rates dependent upon the initial size and the time of formation (summer or autumn). The number of nymphs did not affect colony survival and colony growth. Reproductives developed from nymphs within 2 weeks and later from workers. Many of the reproductives derived from nymphs were killed by workers. The majority of the colonies contained two reproductives 3 years after initiating the tests. In addition, a few individual workers were still alive at the end of the 3-year tests. At the end of the tests, the proportion of soldiers ranged anywhere from 5.23 to 7.69% of the total population.

Since the first report of L. humile in California in 1907 its range expanded statewide, displacing native ant species wherever it spread. Since the discovery of established populations of S. invicta in southern California in 1998, it has been restricted to discrete areas of southern California. However, as these discrete populations expand, they are encountering large populations of L. humile, which are effective competitors for available resources and are particularly aggressive in their encounters with other ant species such as S. invicta. Most Dolichoderine ants such as L. humile do not prefer to forage on baits made with defatted corn grit and soybean oil typically used in red imported fire ant control programs. Applications of these baits in areas where distributions of these species overlap might selectively affect populations of S. invicta and give L. humile a competitive advantage. Three laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the competitive outcomes between S. invicta pitted against L. humile 1) agonistic behavior of workers in small arenas, 2) colony interactions with different population ratios, and 3) the effects of pyriproxyfen on the competitiveness of S. invicta against L. humile. Populations of S. invicta consisting of major workers killed more L. humile than did minors or a mixture of majors and minors. When paired against L. humile colonies consisting of 1,100 workers, colonies consisting of 38 S. invicta workers were easily defeated by L. humile. Colonies consisting of 450 S. invicta workers plugged their nest entrances, but they were ultimately defeated by L. humile after 13 d. The S. invicta colonies consisting of 1,100 workers took control of the bridge connecting the colonies, invaded the L. humile colony, killed the Argentine ant queens, and removed their brood. Pyriproxyfen-treated fire ant workers took significantly longer to chase the Argentine ants from a connecting bridge than did untreated fire ants. Thus, fire ant baits may have long-term effects on intercolonial aggression between S. invicta and L. humile, especially when Argentine ant populations are high in the summer.","Aggressive Interactions Between Solenopsis invicta and Linepithema humile Hymenoptera Formicidae Under Laboratory Conditions electronic resource","The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), and the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, are natural agonists in their country of origin.

There is a lot of information from laboratory tests regarding the effects of chemicals on beneficial predators and parasitoids but very few translations of these effects into field impacts particularly under commercial conditions. To address this issue we calculated a chemical toxicity score for 19 commercial vineyards based on IOBC toxicity ratings and application number, and compared this to extensive field collections to determine if natural enemy populations can be related to predicted toxicity loadings. Invertebrates were sampled four times during the growing season using canopy sticky traps and ground level pitfall traps. Ordination analyses using non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated community structure in vineyards correlated to site chemical use, while principal components analyses identified the taxa involved. One ordination axis from canopy data and two axes from ground level data were correlated to overall IOBC ratings for the vineyards. Principal components analyses indicated that spiders, lacewings, carabids and parasitoids were all affected by chemical use. IOBC rating based on laboratory studies therefore correlated with chemical effects on field populations of natural enemies in commercial vineyards where complexes of pesticides were applied. The use of chemicals with low toxicity to beneficials as predicted by IOBC ratings will contribute to preservation and maintenance of natural enemies in vineyard ecosystems.","Field validation of laboratory-derived IOBC toxicity ratings for natural enemies in commercial vineyard s electronic resource","Management of pests and diseases remains a key issue for agricultural profitability and environmental health.

Flies from a WHO strain, in culture since 1961, and first-generation laboratory-cultured flies from two wild-type strains from a poultry breeding and a cow-house with pigsty, respectively, were compared. On WHO females hydrocarbons with 23-25 C atoms constituted about 65% of the total hydrocarbons, whereas on wild-type females less than 2% of these compounds was present. (Z)-9-tricosene comprised up to 20-30% of the total hydrocarbons on 5-to 20-day-old WHO females, whereas less than 0.5% (Z)-9-tricosene was present on the wild-type females. We also compared the amounts of (Z)-9-tricosene and some other hydrocarbons on female houseflies, kept in culture in the laboratory for several generations. It appeared that whereas on first-generation wild-type females hardly or no (Z)-9-tricosene could be detected, the amounts of this substance had increased considerably after some tens of generations in the laboratory. It is suggested that this was due to selection in subsequent generations of high-density populations. Production of (Z)-9-tricosene and of tricosane was shown to be closely linked. Selection did not affect the production of other cuticular hydrocarbons by the females. It is suggested that in mixed populations (both sexes together in a cage) in the course of time (Z)-9-tricosene is transferred from females to males and (Z)-9-heptacosene from males to females. It is concluded that reproductive ability of houseflies does not primarily depend on the amounts of (Z)-9-tricosene on females, although higher amounts of this substance may increase contacts between males and females.","The effects of laboratory culturing on Z -9-tricosene muscalure quantities on female houseflies","Using gas chromatography the relative amounts of (Z)-9-tricosene (muscalure) and some other hydrocarbons on the cuticle of 1- to 20-day-old houseflies (Musca domestica L.) from different strains were determined.

Most studies of male mating success in Drosophila, however, have been done under conditions very different from those in typical cultures. We determined the distribution of male mating success in five laboratory populations of D. melanogaster maintained on a 14 d, discrete generation cycle fairly representative of standard Drosophila cultures. Mating success was measured as the number of matings a male could achieve under conditions closely approximating a regular culture vial of these populations. Preliminary studies determined that most mating in these populations occurred within 14 h of the flies attaining sexual maturity. Consequently, individual virgin males were marked with white paint on their thorax, put into vials with varying numbers of unmarked virgin flies of both sexes, and monitored continuously for matings over a period of up to 14 h. At various times during the assay, virgin males and females were added to these vials in proportions simulating the pattern of eclosion in culture vials. The observed variation in the number of matings per male in the five populations was, by and large, consistent with a Poisson distribution, suggesting that male mating success in short-generation-time, discrete-generation laboratory cultures of D. melanogaster may fulfil a fundamental assumption of the Wright-Fisher model of genetic drift in finite populations.","Poisson distribution of male mating success in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster","Variation among males and females in reproductive success is a major determinant of effective population size.

"82425",82425,"Horne_2018_Funcecol","Insect temperatureabody size trends common to laboratory, latitudinal and seasonal gradients are not found across altitudes Body size affects rates of most biological and ecological processes, from individual performance to ecosystem function, and is fundamentally linked to organism fitness. Within species, size at maturity can vary systematically with environmental temperature in the laboratory and across seasons, as well as over latitudinal gradients. Recent metaaanalyses have revealed a close match in the magnitude and direction of these size gradients in various arthropod orders, suggesting that these size responses share common drivers. As with increasing latitude, temperature also decreases with increasing altitude. Although the general direction of body size clines along altitudinal gradients has been examined previously, to our knowledge altitudeabody size (AaS) clines have never been synthesised quantitatively, nor compared with temperatureasize (TaS) responses measured under controlled laboratory conditions. Here we quantitatively examine variation in intraspecific AaS clines among 121 insect species from 50 different global locations, representing 12 taxonomic orders. While some taxa were better represented in the literature than others, our analysis reveals extensive variation in the magnitude and direction of AaS clines. Following the assumption that temperature on average declines by 1A'C per 150A m increase in altitude, orderaspecific AaS clines in the field appear to deviate from laboratory TaS responses. Specifically, the magnitude of AaS clines and TaS responses are more closely matched in some taxonomic orders (e.g. Diptera) than others (e.g. Orthoptera). These findings contrast with the strong coavariation observed between latitudeasize clines and TaS responses, and between laboratory and seasonal TaS responses. The lack of clear size relationships with elevation, and hence temperature, is likely due to the counteracting effects of other major drivers with altitude, including season length and oxygen partial pressure. Switches in voltinism within species across altitude, and the dispersal of individuals across different elevations, may also obscure trends. A plain language summary is available for this article.","Insect temperatureabody size trends common to laboratory latitudinal and seasonal gradients are not found across altitudes","Body size affects rates of most biological and ecological processes, from individual performance to ecosystem function, and is fundamentally linked to organism fitness. Within species, size at maturity can vary systematically with environmental temperature in the laboratory and across seasons, as well as over latitudinal gradients. Recent metaaanalyses have revealed a close match in the magnitude and direction of these size gradients in various arthropod orders, suggesting that these size responses share common drivers. As with increasing latitude, temperature also decreases with increasing altitude. Although the general direction of body size clines along altitudinal gradients has been examined previously, to our knowledge altitudeabody size (AaS) clines have never been synthesised quantitatively, nor compared with temperatureasize (TaS) responses measured under controlled laboratory conditions. Here we quantitatively examine variation in intraspecific AaS clines among 121 insect species from 50 different global locations, representing 12 taxonomic orders. While some taxa were better represented in the literature than others, our analysis reveals extensive variation in the magnitude and direction of AaS clines. Following the assumption that temperature on average declines by 1A'C per 150A m increase in altitude, orderaspecific AaS clines in the field appear to deviate from laboratory TaS responses. Specifically, the magnitude of AaS clines and TaS responses are more closely matched in some taxonomic orders (e.g. Diptera) than others (e.g. Orthoptera). These findings contrast with the strong coavariation observed between latitudeasize clines and TaS responses, and between laboratory and seasonal TaS responses.

In addition, the biological data obtained were used to determine parameters of fertility life tables. The results showed that H. armigera does not have a feeding preference among the sunflower genotypes tested. The larval period on sunflower ranged from 15.0 to 16.2days. The maximum fecundity on sunflower was 542.6 eggs/female and that on the artificial diet was 794.5 eggs/female. In general, insects feeding on Helio 250 consumed greater quantities of leaves, had higher survival until the end of the pupal stage, displayed high population growth rates, and had low population doubling times, suggesting that in the field populations will achieve greater population densities when fed on Helio 250. Insects that fed on CF101 consumed smaller leaf areas, had lower survival until the end of the pupal stage, lower fertility rates, and lower population growth rates, and may also have displayed lower population densities and smaller reductions in field productivity.

This has typically comprised of a starting container (initial resource or patch) connected by tubing, which contains thread for the animals to climb into a tube and hence to an end container. That is, beetles move to a new viable resource or patch from an interpatch zone or nonviable habitat. We modified this basic apparatus design to test the effect of tubing length and tubing insertion angle on the dispersal rate and proportion of successful dispersers. We expected that the proportion of successful dispersers would be repeatable within each apparatus design, and that increasing tubing length and steepness of the insertion angle would reduce dispersal rate and success across apparatus designs. Dispersal increased linearly through time, similarly so for both males and females. The design with the most vertical tubing insertion angle had a lower proportion of successful dispersers. Tubing length also had a negative relationship with dispersal success (as judged by insects reaching the end container), but a significant reduction in dispersal success was only apparent between the shortest and longest tubing between containers. We suggest that locating and climbing the vertical section of string before they can enter the tubing between containers restricts dispersal and that at higher densities, insects exhibit greater inclination to climb. This type of apparatus has flexible design tolerances and further potential to study the dispersal of other small insect species that primarily use pedestrian locomotion.","Investigating movement in the laboratory dispersal apparatus designs and the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum","The natural dispersal of Tribolium castaneum Herbst (Coleoptera Tenebrionidae) has been emulated in the laboratory for more than 50 years, using a simple dispersal apparatus.

If so, increased sodium availability through altered deposition and anthropogenic sources may lead to increased colony and population growth and cascading ecological impacts. For red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren, the present study tests (i) whether colonies from coastal and inland sites differ in their responses to NaCl baits; and (ii) whether supplemental NaCl increases growth of fire ant colonies in the laboratory. Fire ants in inland sites with low sodium deposition responded roughly an order of magnitude more strongly to high concentrations of NaCl baits than did fire ants in coastal sites with high sodium deposition. Laboratory colonies of fire ants, however, showed no signs of sodium limitation or benefits of increased sodium. The link between behavioural responses to baits in the field and effects on colony growth deserves further investigation to assess the ecological impacts of altered sodium availability.","Assessing the effects of sodium on fire ant foraging in the field and colony growth in the laboratory electronic resource","Sodium is an essential dietary element and preferential foraging for high concentrations of sodium by inland herbivorous and omnivorous ants suggests it may be limiting.

For red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren, the present study tests (i) whether colonies from coastal and inland sites differ in their responses to NaCl baits; and (ii) whether supplemental NaCl increases growth of fire ant colonies in the laboratory. Fire ants in inland sites with low sodium deposition responded roughly an order of magnitude more strongly to high concentrations of NaCl baits than did fire ants in coastal sites with high sodium deposition. Laboratory colonies of fire ants, however, showed no signs of sodium limitation or benefits of increased sodium. The link between behavioural responses to baits in the field and effects on colony growth deserves further investigation to assess the ecological impacts of altered sodium availability.","foraging and fire ants and population growth and sodium chloride and sodium and ant colonies and Solenopsis invicta and anthropogenic activities and environmental impact and baits","","JOUR","RESASCO, JULIAN and LEVEY, DOUGLAS J. and SANDERS, NATHAN J. and PORTER, SANFORD D.","","Ecological entomology","2014","39","2","267","271","10.1111/een.12089 and 10.1111/een.12089","","revtools"

One way to deal with such variation is to respond to a specific set of compounds common to all host plants. The oriental fruit moth Cydia (=Grapholita) molesta is a highly damaging invasive pest. The stone fruit peach (Prunus persica) is its primary host, whereas pome fruits such as pear (Pyrus communis) are considered secondary hosts. In some parts of their geographic range, moth populations switch from stone to pome fruit orchards during the growing season. Here, we tested whether this temporal switch is facilitated by female responses to plant volatiles. We collected volatiles from peach and pear trees in situ and characterized their seasonal dynamics by gas chromatographymass spectrometry. We also assessed the effects of the natural volatile blends released by the two plant species on female attraction by using Y-tube olfactometry. Finally, we related variations in volatile emissions to female olfactory responses. Our results indicate that the seasonal host switch from peach to pear is facilitated by the changing olfactory effect of the natural volatile blends being emitted. Peach volatiles were only attractive early and mid season, whereas pear volatiles were attractive from mid to late season. Blends from the various attractive stages shared a common set of five aldehydes, which are suggested to play an essential role in female attraction to host plants. Particular attention should be given to these aldehydes when designing candidate attractants for oriental fruit moth females.","Season-Long Volatile Emissions from Peach and Pear Trees In Situ Overlapping Profiles and Olfactory Attraction of an Oligophagous Fruit Moth in the Laboratory electronic resource","Insect herbivores that have more than one generation per year and reproduce on different host plants are confronted with substantial seasonal variation in the volatile blends emitted by their hosts.

It is one of the most important diseases in dogs and other canids in tropical and subtropical regions. The disease is transmitted transstadially, mainly, by the nymph and adult stages of the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Clinically the disease can take the acute or chronic form with a wide range of clinical presentations that include fever, depression, lethargy, dyspnea, anorexia, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hemorrhage, epistaxis, increased hair loss, vomiting, blindness, edema, ataxia and polyarthritis. Superinfection with other organisms can complicate the clinical picture making clinical diagnosis difficult. Several diagnostic tests, notably identification of morulae in blood smears, in-vitro cell culture technique, indirect fluorescent test (IFA), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed for the confirmation of the disease. The abundance of Rhipicephalus sanguineus in most areas in Kenya, due to favorable weather, increases the risk of the disease in dogs kept in such areas despite the control measures. Whenever the small animal clinicians are presented with cases of dogs having non-specific clinical signs, especially in Nairobi and other areas having similar climatic conditions, it would be prudent to consider the possibility of canine ehrlichiosis.

We tested the hypothesis that solitary parasitoids (displaying siblicidal behaviour in their larvae) have narrower host ranges than gregarious parasitoids (with tolerant larvae). In laboratory experiments, we compared parasitization success in two sister species of braconid wasp [Aphaereta genevensis (Fischer), solitary, and Aphaereta pallipes (Say), gregarious (Hymenoptera Braconidae Alysiini)] on eight Drosophila species or strains. Host species or strain was the most important factor affecting parasitization success, and some of this variation was accountable to host physiological defences. Although two hosts were more suitable for the solitary species, and one more suitable for the gregarious species, these differences were small, and there was no consistent difference across all hosts. Wasp body size was positively correlated with parasitization success in both wasp species. This may be because body size increases oviposition success, or the motivation to oviposit. In A. pallipes parasitization success peaked after 3-4 days, but later in A. genevensis. This is likely due to low life expectancy and high egg loads increasing oviposition tendency in young A. pallipes, and egg limitation decreasing oviposition tendency in old A. pallipes. These data suggest that interactions among wasp larvae do not greatly affect the size of the fundamental niche examined here. However, they show the potential for life history traits, which differ between the species as a likely consequence of larval interactions, to affect the extent of the realized niche.","Host range in solitary versus gregarious parasitoids a laboratory experiment","Behavioural interactions among relatives may have consequences for many other traits.

However, they show the potential for life history traits, which differ between the species as a likely consequence of larval interactions, to affect the extent of the realized niche.","host range and insect pests and life expectancy and life history and natural enemies and oviposition and parasitism and parasitoids and plant pests and Aphaereta pallipes and Drosophila funebris and Drosophila immigrans and Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila subobscura and Drosophila virilis and insects and Aphaereta and Braconidae and Hymenoptera and insects and Hexapoda and arthropods and invertebrates and animals and natural enemies and eukaryotes and Drosophila and Drosophilidae and Diptera and Aphaereta genevensis and Drosophila busckii and Drosophila seguyi and Drosophila willistoni and pest insects and Plant Pests (FF620) (New March 2000) and Reproduction, Development and Life Cycle (Wild Animals) (YY200) (New March 2000) and Behaviour (Wild Animals) (YY500) (New March 2000) and Pathogens, Parasites and Infectious Diseases (Wild Animals) (YY700) (New March 2000) and Animal Ecology (ZZ332)","","JOUR","Traynor, R.

In the laboratory, the technical material showed a high level of activity against 2nd and 4th instar larvae. The inhibition of emergence (IE) was 100% at concentrations of 0.25-1.0 g/litre. Second instars were slightly more susceptible than 4th instars. At a high concentration (1 ppb), most of the mortality occurred in larvae, but at sublethal concentrations (for larvae) mortality also occurred in pupae and adults (incomplete eclosion). An EC10 (emulsifiable concentrate containing 10% active ingredient) formulation of novaluron was evaluated against A. aegypti in water-storage containers in the field in Thailand. Two tests at high (0.05-1 mg/litre) and low (1-20 g/litre) concentrations were carried out in clay jars (200 litres) and plastic pails (75 litres). At high concentrations in clay jars, we obtained 86-96% IE for about 190 days, but the mortality declined at low concentrations after 190 days. At much lower concentrations, in jars and plastic pails in the second experiment, the IE was 80-100% for 2 months.

A differential biomarker approach under laboratory and field conditions The two function-specific metallothionein (MT) isoforms characterized from the midgut gland and mantle tissue of Helix pomatia differ substantially in their metal-binding preferences, as well as molecular and biochemical features. These differences make them potential candidates for biomarker studies based on a differential, isoform-specific approach. To prove this hypothesis, induction experiments with two metals (Cd and Cu) that are normally bound by the two isoforms were compared with a range of organic chemicals and physical stressors under laboratory conditions to test the responsiveness of the two isoforms to the stressors applied. In addition, field studies were conducted with Roman snails and substrate samples collected from different metal-contaminated sites in Austria to test the suitability of the two isoforms as biomarkers under field conditions. The results of these combined laboratory and field studies confirmed the validity of the biomarker approach with the two metal- and tissue-specific isoforms. It is demonstrated that the Cd-binding MT specifically and exclusively responds to Cd exposure by increasing concentrations, whereas the Cu-binding MT isoform decreases in its concentration upon exposure to physical stress (X-ray irradiation and cold). This suggests researchers should adopt, under certain preconditions, a dual biomarker approach by combining the simultaneous quantification of Cd-MT concentrations in the midgut gland as a biomarker for Cd pollution and of Cu-MT concentration in the mantle as a biomarker for the impairment of snails by additional physical stressors.","Isoform-specific quantification of metallothionein in the terrestrial gastropod Helix pomatia II A differential biomarker approach under laboratory and field conditions","The two function-specific metallothionein (MT) isoforms characterized from the midgut gland and mantle tissue of Helix pomatia differ substantially in their metal-binding preferences, as well as molecular and biochemical features.

In the surface contamination experiment, another 25 larvae of each mosquito species that were exposed to the same bacterial spore concentrations (same exposure time) were examined for bacterial count. Four larvae of each exposed mosquito were also examined by electron microscopy. After ingestion by C. pipiens and A. pharoensis larvae, B. sphaericus spores rapidly germinated in the midgut.

All strains tolerated high levels of PCBs; however, both wild-derived strains exhibited unexpected increased survival upon exposure to moderate levels of PCBs alone, whereas the long-established laboratory strain exhibited lowered larval survival in the presence of PCBs. This was not related to a lack of uptake of PCBs by the wild-derived flies, since uptake was high and all major Aroclor GC fractions were represented in the emerging flies. There was increased effectiveness of insecticides in the presence of PCBs on the long-established laboratory strain, but there was no such synergism with insecticides for the wild-derived flies.

The results showed that the presence of GNA in the diet throughout the insect's life cycle decreased the fecundity of adult aphids, as measured by nymph production, by up to 65%, but normally caused only a marginal decrease (10%) in aphid survival. The deleterious effect of GNA was significantly reduced if insects were reared on control diet, and transferred to diet containing GNA at maturity. GNA was also shown to affect the development of nymphal aphids by measuring growth using image analysis software. The presence of GNA in the diet decreased the rate of increase in length and width of the aphids by up to 40%, and, in this assay, also caused high levels of mortality. GNA was expressed in potato plants, (Solanum tuberosum L.) cv. Desire, after transformation with a construct containing a gene encoding the protein driven by the CaMV 35S promoter. GNA expression levels in transgenic potato leaves were found to be in the range 0.3-0.4% of total soluble protein, as measured by immunodot blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against the protein. Bioassays carried out under controlled environmental conditions, using clip cages, showed that the number of nymphs produced on these transgenic plants was significantly (P&lt;0.01) reduced compared to that on non-transgenic control plants. The decrease in fecundity observed in this bioassay was similar to that seen in the artificial diet bioassays. Large scale glasshouse trials showed that the rate of population build-up on the GNA-expressing plants was approximately four-fold lower than on the control plants. These experiments demonstrate that the insecticidal effects of GNA observed in artificial diets can be reproduced in planta, both under laboratory bioassay conditions and in the glasshouse.","Snowdrop lectin inhibits development and decreases fecundity of the glasshouse potato aphid Aulacorthum solani when administered in vitro and via transgenic plants both in laboratory and glasshouse trials","The effects of snowdrop lectin (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, GNA) on Aulacorthum solani were tested by bioassays where the protein was incorporated into an artificial diet at a single concentration of 0.1% (w/v).

In the presence of host stimuli, the sugar-feeding rhythms of Anopheles quadrimaculatus, C. quinquefasciatus and Aedes triseriatus differed from those obtained in the absence of host stimuli by having an earlier onset of evening activity, a relatively smaller evening activity peak, and a more irregular activity pattern during early scotophase, respectively.

The development is described of a computer model designed to simulate the aphid's population dynamics on saplings in the laboratory, in the absence of natural enemies. The model was able to account for about 80% of the variation in aphid numbers within and between trees over a 3-month period. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the number of aphids was limited primarily by nymphal emigration, the operation of which is sensitive to density and plant quality. Of secondary importance were changes in reproduction acting through increased reproductive delay, again a result of altered growth rates and adult size. Development, too, had an important secondary influence.

No phase variation was observed between isolated and crowded stocks in respect of colour, morphometrics, weight of hatchings or fledgings. All the females reared in isolation had seven nymphal instars, but isolated males had mostly six and some seven. This variation was also observed in the crowded stock for both males and females. In isolation, the mean nymphal life of 15 females was 78.7 plus or minus 3.2 days, the mean for nine males having six instars was 59.9 plus or minus 3.2 days and that for five males having seven instars was 74.6 plus or minus 3.8 days. Over-all, the nymphal life of the insects reared in crowds was slightly shorter, but no attempt was made to separate those having six or seven instars. The stripes in the compound eye were correlated with the number of nymphal instars. Colour changes in the compound eye coincided with over-all body colour changes and maturation. The mean maturation period of females reared in isolation was 101 days, varying from 72 to 158 days. The mean maturation period of the crowded females, estimated by collection of the first egg-pod, was 73 days, with a range of 62 to 84 days; when estimated by the collection of egg-pods averaging one/female, it varied with the cage from 91 to 114 days. This suggests that maturation in the crowded females was quicker. Isolated females lived longer than crowded ones and laid more egg-pods. There was, however, no difference in the number of eggs/pod or their hatchability. In both cases, 76% of the eggs hatched. Hence, isolated females had a greater fecundity than crowded ones.

The nymphal diapause is induced by a short daylength at a low temperature during the nymphal development. The geographical variation of the photoperiodic diapause response was studied by selecting a line which enters diapause at the 3rd-instar or at the 4th-instar depending on photoperiod. The 3rd-instar diapausing line (H3) and the 4th-instar diapausing line (H4) were established by the 7th generation. The proportion of the 3rd-instar diapausing nymphs in the H3 line appearing under daylengths of less than 11 h increased along with the selection. The daylength inducing the 3rd-instar diapause apparently became longer as the selection proceeded. The daylength inducing the 4th-instar diapause which corresponded to 13-14 h in the original stock became shorter in the H4 line and longer in the H3 line. It was also noted that 2% of the nymphs of the 6th and 7th generation in the H3 line entered diapause at the 2nd instar under daylengths of 8-9 h. The incidence of 3rd instar diapause increased under low temperatures in the dark phase at LD 816. The flexible response of the diapause incidence to shorter daylengths at low temperatures seems advantageous; when nymphs hatch in early autumn the temperature is suitable for nymphal development before the onset of diapause at the 4th instar by the end of autumn. However, nymphs that hatch in late autumn are able to enter diapause at an earlier instar under shorter daylength than in the former case before the temperature lowers, particularly when temperature fluctuates. The results suggest that L. striatella occurring in areas located further north may evolve a geographical strain entering diapause at the 3rd or even at the 2rd instar under natural conditions.","Flexible diapause response to photoperiod of a laboratory selected line in the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus Falln","In most parts of mainland Japan, the delphacid rice pest Laodelphax striatella overwinters mainly as diapausing 4th-instar nymphs and partly as 3rd-instar nymphs.

(Hymenoptera, Chalcidoidea, Eulophidae) in laboratorio e in pieno campo The extension of strawberry cultivation near Venice in 1960-68 resulted in an outbreak of strawberry Tortricids [cf. RAE/A 59, 3481], of which the commonest was Choristoneura lafauryana (Rag.); numbers fell sharply, however, and a larval ectoparasite, Colpoclypeus florus (Wlk.), increased when chemical treatment was suspended. This Eulophid was studied in the laboratory at Padua in 1971-72 and in the field near Verona in 1966-67 in order to find whether it could be used for biological control. Several other Tortricids besides Choristoneura were attacked by it, the main requisite for parasitism being the consistency and quality of the silk spun by the host larva, which the parasite female tested before ovipositing on the webbing. The host larva was paralysed by a substance injected through the ovipositor; some larvae died and others developed normally if they were not attacked by the slow-moving parasite larvae (of which 30% failed to find hosts and died). The Colpoclypeus females laid 10-30 eggs each in the laboratory; those from mated females gave rise to both sexes and those from unmated females to females only, which were able to continue parthenogenetic reproduction with decreasing numbers for four generations. The egg, larval and pupal stages lasted 2, 5-6 and 6 days, respectively, at 26 deg C, and the adults lived for about 6 days, pairing occurring immediately after emergence. Each host larva was able to support 12-30 parasite larvae according to size, and in the field several females sometimes oviposited near a single larva. C. florus had eight generations a year in the field, overwintering as a full-fed larva in the leaf rolled by its host and giving rise to the adult at the end of March or beginning of April. The percentage parasitism was highest (up to 95%) in autumn and lowest in summer, especially if insecticide treatments were in progress. In the test fruit-garden, the parasite attacked first Choristoneura, Pandemis dumetana (Treitschke) and Argyroploce lacunana (Schiff.) on strawberry, from late May Ancylis comptana (Froel.) on strawberry and Argyrotaenia pulchellana (Haw.) on apple, and in autumn A. pulchellana and Adoxophyes orana (Fisch. v. Roesl.) (reticulana (Hb.)) on apple and peach. In the field the Eulophid multiplies rapidly and is a useful control agent on untreated land, but in the laboratory the high larval mortality and low female fecundity make mass-rearing for releases impracticable.

There was no difference between the resuls for laboratory-bred and wild-caught mosquitoes. A. polynesiensis fed on low carrriers (around 20 Mf/ml and less) gave an average infection rate of 4.9%.

Open mushrooms (which were all visited by slugs) produced more flies than mushrooms from which slugs were excluded.

Quantifying the relative impact of multiple chemicals on bee health compared with other environmental stressors (e.g. varroa, viruses, and nutrition) has been identified as a priority to support the development of holistic risk assessment methods. Here, extensive literature searches and data collection of available laboratory studies on combined toxicity data for binary mixtures of pesticides and non-chemical stressors has been performed for honey bees (Apis mellifera), wild bees (Bombus spp.) and solitary bee species (Osmia spp.). From 957 screened publications, 14 publications provided 218 binary mixture toxicity data mostly for acute mortality (lethal dose LD50) after contact exposure (61%), with fewer studies reporting chronic oral toxicity (20%) and acute oral LC50 values (19%). From the data collection, available dose response data for 92 binary mixtures were modelled using a Toxic Unit (TU) approach and the MIXTOX modelling tool to test assumptions of combined toxicity i.e. concentration addition (CA), and interactions (i.e. synergism, antagonism). The magnitude of interactions was quantified as the Model Deviation Ratio (MDR). The CA model applied to 17% of cases while synergism and antagonism were observed for 72% (MDR &gt;1.25) and 11% (MDR &lt;0.83) respectively. Most synergistic effects (55%) were observed as interactions between sterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting (SBI) fungicides and insecticide/acaricide. The mechanisms behind such synergistic effects of binary mixtures in bees are known to involve direct cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition, resulting in an increase in internal dose and toxicity of the binary mixture. Moreover, bees are known to have the lowest number of CYP copies and other detoxification enzymes in the insect kingdom. In the light of these findings, occurrence of these binary mixtures in relevant crops (frequency and concentrations) would need to be investigated. Addressing this exposure dimension remains critical to characterise the likelihood and plausibility of such interactions to occur under field realistic conditions. Finally, data gaps and further work for the development of risk assessment methods to assess multiple stressors in bees including chemicals and non-chemical stressors in bees are discussed.","Investigating combined toxicity of binary mixtures in bees meta-analysis of laboratory tests modelling mechanistic basis and implications for risk assessment","Bees are exposed to a wide range of multiple chemicals ""chemical mixtures"" from anthropogenic (e.g. plant protection products or veterinary products) or natural origin (e.g. mycotoxins, plant toxins).

The gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) is an insect folivore that feeds on a broad range of hosts, and undergoes intermittent outbreaks that cause extensive tree mortality. Like many other herbivorous insects, gypsy moth larvae consume a substrate that is low in nitrogen. Gypsy moth larvae have been known to cannibalize under crowded conditions in the laboratory. In this study, we assessed the influence of nitrogen and density on cannibalism behavior in gypsy moth larvae. Cannibalism rates increased with decreased nitrogen and increased density. There was no interaction between these two parameters. Developmental experiments confirmed that low dietary nitrogen is detrimental, in agreement with previous studies. In a second experiment, we assessed the influence of previous cannibalism experiences on subsequent cannibalism behavior. Gypsy moth larvae that had previously cannibalized other larvae subsequently exhibited higher cannibalism rates than those larvae that had not cannibalized. In conclusion, low nitrogen, high larval density, and previous cannibalism experience are important factors contributing to gypsy moth larval cannibalism. Future studies are needed to estimate benefits to larvae, and to more closely approximate field conditions.","Influence of diet and density on laboratory cannibalism behaviors in gypsy moth larvae Lymantria dispar L","The gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) is an insect folivore that feeds on a broad range of hosts, and undergoes intermittent outbreaks that cause extensive tree mortality.

"220942",220942,"Samietz_2014_EuJoofEn","Comparison of the mating behaviour of a bush cricket in the laboratory and the field calling activity and mating frequency of a long-winged species, Phaneroptera falcata (Ensifera Tettigoniidae) Bush crickets are a model group for testing hypotheses in sexual selection, but much of the information is based on laboratory observations on wingless or short-winged species, which may restrict their generality. Here we describe aspects of the mating behaviour of the long-winged European bush cricket Phaneroptera falcata (Poda, 1761). Both in the laboratory and the field, diel calling followed a normal, though slightly left-skewed distribution, peaking about three hours after sunset or lights-off. Under bright greenhouse conditions, when the light was suddenly switched off, calling occurred only after the onset of darkness. Decreasing light intensity may trigger the start of calling activity. In the field, calling decreased from midnight onwards, which may be related to a decrease in temperature. The sequence of events during copulation was identical in the laboratory and the field. However, in two of 14 copulations documented in the field, a pre-copulatory behaviour was observed that resembled the putative removal and ingestion of rival sperm. Previous suggestions that P. falcata (Poda) is monogamous are rejected on the basis of both laboratory and field results. In the laboratory males and females mated every 2.3 and 3.6 days, respectively. We introduce a simple way to calculate the average frequency of mating in the field, based on the observation that at any one time 3% of all the individuals are recorded mating and copulation lasts 15 min. We estimate that on average P. falcata (Poda) mates once per day. More generally, our results show it is important for evolutionary conclusions to measure behaviourial data in the field.","Comparison of the mating behaviour of a bush cricket in the laboratory and the field calling activity and mating frequency of a long-winged species Phaneroptera falcata Ensifera Tettigoniidae","Bush crickets are a model group for testing hypotheses in sexual selection, but much of the information is based on laboratory observations on wingless or short-winged species, which may restrict their generality. Here we describe aspects of the mating behaviour of the long-winged European bush cricket Phaneroptera falcata (Poda, 1761). Both in the laboratory and the field, diel calling followed a normal, though slightly left-skewed distribution, peaking about three hours after sunset or lights-off. Under bright greenhouse conditions, when the light was suddenly switched off, calling occurred only after the onset of darkness. Decreasing light intensity may trigger the start of calling activity. In the field, calling decreased from midnight onwards, which may be related to a decrease in temperature. The sequence of events during copulation was identical in the laboratory and the field. However, in two of 14 copulations documented in the field, a pre-copulatory behaviour was observed that resembled the putative removal and ingestion of rival sperm.

"221023",221023,"Kimura_2014_PLoONE","Development of a new method to track multiple honey bees with complex behaviors on a flat laboratory arena A computer program that tracks animal behavior, thereby revealing various features and mechanisms of social animals, is a powerful tool in ethological research. Because honeybee colonies are populated by thousands of bees, individuals co-exist in high physical densities and are difficult to track unless specifically tagged, which can affect behavior. In addition, honeybees react to light and recordings must be made under special red-light conditions, which the eyes of bees perceive as darkness. The resulting video images are scarcely distinguishable. We have developed a new algorithm, K-Track, for tracking numerous bees in a flat laboratory arena. Our program implements three main processes (A) The object (bee's) region is detected by simple threshold processing on gray scale images, (B) Individuals are identified by size, shape and spatiotemporal positional changes, and (C) Centers of mass of identified individuals are connected through all movie frames to yield individual behavioral trajectories. The tracking performance of our software was evaluated on movies of mobile multi-artificial agents and of 16 bees walking around a circular arena. K-Track accurately traced the trajectories of both artificial agents and bees. In the latter case, K-track outperformed Ctrax, well-known software for tracking multiple animals. To investigate interaction events in detail, we manually identified five interaction categories; 'crossing', 'touching', 'passing', 'overlapping' and 'waiting', and examined the extent to which the models accurately identified these categories from bee's interactions. All 7 identified failures occurred near a wall at the outer edge of the arena. Finally, K-Track and Ctrax successfully tracked 77 and 60 of 84 recorded interactive events, respectively. K-Track identified multiple bees on a flat surface and tracked their speed changes and encounters with other bees, with good performance.","Development of a new method to track multiple honey bees with complex behaviors on a flat laboratory arena","A computer program that tracks animal behavior, thereby revealing various features and mechanisms of social animals, is a powerful tool in ethological research.

Meanwhile, in Rio Grande do Sul (RS, Southern Brazil) the first autochthonous case occurred only in 2007. Methodology and Principal Findings In this study we report laboratory surveillance of dengue cases and seasonality of positive cases, describe serotypes and characterize the epidemiological pattern of dengue in RS from 2007 to 2013. A total of 9,779 serum samples from patients with suspected dengue fever were collected and submitted to molecular and/or serological analyses for dengue virus identification and serotyping, based on viral isolation, NS1 antigen detection and qRT-PCR, or Dengue IgM capture ELISA and MAC-ELISA. The first autochthonous dengue case in RS was confirmed in 2007 (DENV-3). While in 2008 and 2009 only imported cases were registered, autochthonous infection waves have been occurring since 2010. The highest number of dengue infections occurred in 2010, with DENV-1 and DENV-2 outbreaks in Northwestern RS. In 2011, another DENV-1 and DENV-2 outbreak occurred in the Northwestern region; moreover, DENV-4 was detected in travelers. In 2012, DENV-1 and DENV-4 co-circulated. DENV-2 circulation was only detected again in 2013, in high frequency (56.7%), co-circulating with DENV-4 (35%). Most infections occur in adults during summer. Differences in prevalence between genders were observed in 2007 (60% females), 2008 (60.8% males) and 2009 (77.5% males). Conclusions According to results of dengue surveillance, there was an increase in the number of dengue cases in RS and of cities infested with Aedes aegypti, possibly as a consequence of introduction of new serotypes and the difficulty of health programs to control the vector.","Laboratory surveillance of dengue in Rio Grande do Sul Brazil from 2007 to 2013","Background According to official records, dengue was introduced in Brazil in the 80's; since then several epidemics have occurred.

"222486",222486,"Marti_2013_InJoofTrInSc","Exploration for Triatoma virus (TrV) infection in laboratory-reared triatomines of Latin America a collaborative study Triatoma virus (TrV) is a small, non-enveloped virus that has a +ssRNA genome and is currently classified under the Cripavirus genus of the Dicistroviridae family. TrV infects haematophagous triatomine insects (Hemiptera Reduviidae), which are vectors of American trypanosomosis (Chagas disease). TrV can be transmitted through the horizontal faecal-oral route, and causes either deleterious sublethal effects or even the death of laboratory insect colonies. Various species of triatomines from different regions of Latin America are currently being reared in research laboratories, with little or no awareness of the presence of TrV; therefore, any biological conclusion drawn from experiments on insects infected with this virus is inherently affected by the side effects of its infection. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to estimate the sample size required for detecting a TrV infection. We applied this model to screen the infection in the faeces of triatomines belonging to insectaries from 13 Latin American countries, carrying out the identification of TrV by using RT-PCR. TrV was detected in samples coming from Argentina, which is where the virus was first isolated from Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera Reduviidae) several years ago. Interestingly, several colonies from Brazil were also found infected with the virus. This positive result widens the TrV's host range to a total of 14 triatomine species. Our findings suggest that many triatomine species distributed over a large region of South America may be naturally infected with TrV.","Exploration for Triatoma virus TrV infection in laboratory-reared triatomines of Latin America a collaborative study","Triatoma virus (TrV) is a small, non-enveloped virus that has a +ssRNA genome and is currently classified under the Cripavirus genus of the Dicistroviridae family.

In addition it is important to determine the relative benefits to the productivity of these cultivars of controlling the chilli thrips with insecticides. Therefore the effects of the chilli thrips on 11 pepper cultivars (Capsicum spp.; Solanales Solanaceae) were tested in greenhouse and laboratory environments. When data for spinetoram-treated and untreated plants of each cultivar were pooled, the number of pedicels, number of flowers, and total (pedicels + flowers + fruit) differed between cultivars, and 'Astry' and 'Cheyenne' had the highest counts of these organs, while 'Hot Habanero Orange' and 'Hot Fatalli' had the least. When cultivars were pooled for spinetoram-treated separately from untreated plants, spinetoram was found to have increased the numbers of pedicels and total counted plant organs. For spinetoram-treated plants, 'Hot San Ardo' had the greatest canopy volume and 'Hot Fatalli' the smallest, whereas 'Fresno 6022' had the most fruits and 'Hot Fatalli' had the least.

A greenhouse choice test indicated 'Fresno 6022', 'Hot Tormenta', 'Hot Fatalli', 'Hot San Ardo', 'Hot Habanero Orange', 'Numex Big Jim', and 'Jamaican Yellow' each had fewer larvae per plant than 'Astry'.

One way to deal with such variation is to respond to a specific set of compounds common to all host plants. The oriental fruit moth Cydia (=Grapholita) molesta is a highly damaging invasive pest. The stone fruit peach (Prunus persica) is its primary host, whereas pome fruits such as pear (Pyrus communis) are considered secondary hosts. In some parts of their geographic range, moth populations switch from stone to pome fruit orchards during the growing season. Here, we tested whether this temporal switch is facilitated by female responses to plant volatiles. We collected volatiles from peach and pear trees in situ and characterized their seasonal dynamics by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We also assessed the effects of the natural volatile blends released by the two plant species on female attraction by using Y-tube olfactometry. Finally, we related variations in volatile emissions to female olfactory responses. Our results indicate that the seasonal host switch from peach to pear is facilitated by the changing olfactory effect of the natural volatile blends being emitted. Peach volatiles were only attractive early and mid season, whereas pear volatiles were attractive from mid to late season. Blends from the various attractive stages shared a common set of five aldehydes, which are suggested to play an essential role in female attraction to host plants. Particular attention should be given to these aldehydes when designing candidate attractants for oriental fruit moth females.","Season-long volatile emissions from peach and pear trees in situ overlapping profiles and olfactory attraction of an oligophagous fruit moth in the laboratory","Insect herbivores that have more than one generation per year and reproduce on different host plants are confronted with substantial seasonal variation in the volatile blends emitted by their hosts.

"225994",225994,"Lukas_2010_Juli","How methodical approaches affects results of pest sampling in stores and counting in laboratory In this study we analyzed impact of the method of sampling of pests in stores on the subsequent counting of pests in the laboratory. First, we compared results obtained from two methods of sampling a highly infested flat grain store (surface sampling with cup-sampler vs. subsurface sampling with spear-sampler) and two extraction methods (Tullgren apparatus vs. automated sieving machine). For samples collected from the same store and sampling date, we found that pest population density and spatial distribution differed significantly between methods. Sampling method had a significant influence on number of trapped arthropods surface sampling recovered significantly more arthropods than use of spear-sampler (LR chi-squared test 2=4.46, d.f.=1, P=0.034). Number of identified arthropod species was not influenced by sampling method (LR chi-squared test 2=1.91, d.f.=1, P=0.167). The Tullgren apparatus extracted consistently more arthropods from samples than the automated sieving machine, but the difference was not significant (LR chi-squared test 2=3.55, d.f.=1, P=0.059). The extraction method also did not influence the number of arthropod species (LR chi-squared test 2=9.5-09, d.f.=1, P=0.99). Different combinations of sampling/extracting methods led to different estimations of infestation levels and their location. The most sensitive approach to estimate arthropod pests' abundance and spatial distribution revealed to be a combination of surface sampling and Tullgren extraction. Using the sieving machine to extract arthropod individuals from sampling spear samples gave the poorest picture of pests' status in the inspected store (Stejskal et al., 2008). Second, we compared results of counting mites and psocids in samples obtained either by digital image analysis (DIA) or traditional visual direct counting (VDC) under a binocular microscope. Our DIA method estimated the number of arthropod individuals using distinguishing features of size and shape. The accuracy and time required were similar to those of the traditional direct visual counting approach when samples comprise fewer than 100 individuals. However, as the true sample size increased above 100 individuals, the DIA method was significantly more precise and quicker than visual counting. The direct visual counting method always underestimated the number of individuals per sample. As expected, the time required for direct visual counting increased with sample size, while the time required for DIAbased counting remained the same. Thus, the DIA method is 10 times quicker than the direct visual counting method with a sample of 500 mites (Lukas et al., 2009). Our work shows that different sampling, extraction and counting methods may convey different infestation ""pictures"" for the same store. The methodological approach used profoundly affects the evaluation of population density and interpretation of obtained results.","How methodical approaches affects results of pest sampling in stores and counting in laboratory","In this study we analyzed impact of the method of sampling of pests in stores on the subsequent counting of pests in the laboratory. First, we compared results obtained from two methods of sampling a highly infested flat grain store (surface sampling with cup-sampler vs. subsurface sampling with spear-sampler) and two extraction methods (Tullgren apparatus vs. automated sieving machine). For samples collected from the same store and sampling date, we found that pest population density and spatial distribution differed significantly between methods. Sampling method had a significant influence on number of trapped arthropods surface sampling recovered significantly more arthropods than use of spear-sampler (LR chi-squared test 2=4.46, d.f.=1, P=0.034). Number of identified arthropod species was not influenced by sampling method (LR chi-squared test 2=1.91, d.f.=1, P=0.167). The Tullgren apparatus extracted consistently more arthropods from samples than the automated sieving machine, but the difference was not significant (LR chi-squared test 2=3.55, d.f.=1, P=0.059). The extraction method also did not influence the number of arthropod species (LR chi-squared test 2=9.5-09, d.f.=1, P=0.99). Different combinations of sampling/extracting methods led to different estimations of infestation levels and their location. The most sensitive approach to estimate arthropod pests' abundance and spatial distribution revealed to be a combination of surface sampling and Tullgren extraction. Using the sieving machine to extract arthropod individuals from sampling spear samples gave the poorest picture of pests' status in the inspected store (Stejskal et al., 2008). Second, we compared results of counting mites and psocids in samples obtained either by digital image analysis (DIA) or traditional visual direct counting (VDC) under a binocular microscope. Our DIA method estimated the number of arthropod individuals using distinguishing features of size and shape. The accuracy and time required were similar to those of the traditional direct visual counting approach when samples comprise fewer than 100 individuals. However, as the true sample size increased above 100 individuals, the DIA method was significantly more precise and quicker than visual counting. The direct visual counting method always underestimated the number of individuals per sample. As expected, the time required for direct visual counting increased with sample size, while the time required for DIAbased counting remained the same. Thus, the DIA method is 10 times quicker than the direct visual counting method with a sample of 500 mites (Lukas et al., 2009). Our work shows that different sampling, extraction and counting methods may convey different infestation ""pictures"" for the same store.

Prey availability strongly reduced cannibalism within individuals of the same age and others of different ages. Complex habitat structure provides shelter for mantid individuals although it could not prevent cannibalism. High density of mantid nymphs or adults increased cannibalism.

In the present study, experiments were conducted to examine short-term transmission efficiency and long-term persistence of symptomatic MdSGHV infections in confined house fly populations. Average rates of disease transmission from virus-infected to healthy flies in small populations of 50 or 100 flies ranged from 3% to 24% and did not vary between three tested geographical strains that originated from different continents. Introduction of an initial proportion of 40% infected flies into fly populations did not result in epizootics. Instead, long-term observations demonstrated that MdSGHV infection levels declined over time, resulting in a 10% infection rate after passing through 10 filial generations. In all experiments, induced disease rates were significantly higher in male flies than in female flies and might be explained by male-specific behaviors that increased contact with viremic flies and/or virus-contaminated surfaces.","Disease dynamics and persistence of Musca domestica salivary gland hypertrophy virus infections in laboratory house fly Musca domestica populations","Past surveys of feral house fly populations have shown that Musca domestica salivary gland hypertrophy virus (MdSGHV) has a worldwide distribution, with an average prevalence varying between 0.5% and 10%.

Synovial fluid obtained by needle aspiration during a recent visit to the Philippines had yielded a white cell count of 12 200 cells/l (55% polymorphonucleocytes) without bacteria. She returned to Australia and was referred to an orthopaedic surgeon. Her physical examination revealed chronically discharging wounds at previous aspiration sites of the medial and lateral aspects of the knee, which was swollen and tender but with good range of movement. She was afebrile and her C-reactive protein level was 18 mg/litre. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated florid erosive synovitis, considered most consistent with rheumatoid or seronegative arthritis, although bone oedema was noted, suggesting osteomyelitis. Bacterial culture of material from the sinuses was negative. The first stage (debridement, spacer implantation and intravenous antibiotic therapy for 4 weeks) of a planned 2-stage total knee replacement was performed. She received intraoperative and postoperative empirical treatment with vancomycin. Microscopic examination of intraoperative specimens for bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria was negative. However, histopathological examination revealed numerous epithelioid granulomata with scattered multinucleated giant cells and a dense chronic lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate. Some giant cells contained structures with characteristics suggestive of Coccidioides species. Five intraoperative specimens inoculated on Sabouraud dextrose agar grew a white fluffy fungus on day 2 of incubation. C. immitis was identified by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Her travel history revealed a period of residence in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, prior to moving to the Philippines. Immediately after leaving the US, she had symptoms of a respiratory illness followed by knee pain and swelling. Liposomal amphotericin 4 mg/kg daily was commenced and was replaced with oral itraconazole 200 mg twice daily. The second stage of joint replacement (removal of spacer and insertion of a prosthetic joint) was undertaken 4 weeks later. The operative wound healed well, clinical evidence of infection resolved and she became ambulant. After 4 weeks of therapy, itraconazole toxicity occurred manifested by anorexia and hypokaliaemia and was successfully managed with dose reduction and ongoing therapeutic drug monitoring.

Anopheles darlingi is a major malaria vector in the Amazon, representing &gt;95% of total Anopheles population present in the Porto Velho region. Despite its importance in the transmission of the Plasmodium parasite, knowledge of the larval biology and ecology is limited. Studies regarding aspects of adult population ecology are more common than studies on larval ecology. However, in order develop effective control strategies and laboratory breeding conditions for this species, more data on the factors affecting vector biology is needed. The aim of the present study is to assess the effects of larval food quantity on the vectorial capacity of An. darling under laboratory conditions. Methods Anopheles darlingi was maintained at 28degreesC, 80% humidity and exposed to a daily photoperiod of 12 h. Larvae were divided into three experimental groups that were fed either a low, medium, or high food supply (based on the food amounts consumed by other species of culicids). Each experiment was replicated for six times. A cohort of adults were also exposed to each type of diet and assessed for several biological characteristics (e.g. longevity, bite frequency and survivorship), which were used to estimate the vectorial capacity of each experimental group. Results The group supplied with higher food amounts observed a reduction in development time while larval survival increased. In addition to enhanced longevity, increasing larval food quantity was positively correlated with increasing frequency of bites, longer blood meal duration and wing length, resulting in greater vectorial capacity. However, females had greater longevity than males despite having smaller wings. Conclusions Overall, several larval and adult biological traits were significantly affected by larval food availability. Greater larval food supply led to enhance larval and production and larger mosquitoes with longer longevity and higher biting frequency. Thus, larval food availability can alter important biological traits that influence the vectorial capacity of An. darlingi.","Larval food quantity affects development time survival and adult biological traits that influence the vectorial capacity of anopheles darlingi under laboratory conditions","Background The incidence of malaria in the Amazon is seasonal and mosquito vectorial capacity parameters, including abundance and longevity, depend on quantitative and qualitative aspects of the larval diet.

Bioaccumulation is a complex, multifaceted process, which calls for accurate error analysis. Yet, attempts to quantify and compare propagation of error in bioaccumulation metrics across species and chemicals are rare. Here, we quantitatively assessed the combined influence of physicochemical, physiological, ecological, and environmental parameters known to affect bioaccumulation for 4 species and 2 chemicals, to assess whether uncertainty in these factors can explain the observed differences among laboratory and field studies. The organisms evaluated in simulations including mayfly larvae, deposit-feeding polychaetes, yellow perch, and little owl represented a range of ecological conditions and biotransformation capacity. The chemicals, pyrene and the polychlorinated biphenyl congener PCB-153, represented medium and highly hydrophobic chemicals with different susceptibilities to biotransformation. An existing state of the art probabilistic bioaccumulation model was improved by accounting for bioavailability and absorption efficiency limitations, due to the presence of black carbon in sediment, and was used for probabilistic modeling of variability and propagation of error. Results showed that at lower trophic levels (mayfly and polychaete), variability in bioaccumulation was mainly driven by sediment exposure, sediment composition and chemical partitioning to sediment components, which was in turn dominated by the influence of black carbon. At higher trophic levels (yellow perch and the little owl), food web structure (i.e., diet composition and abundance) and chemical concentration in the diet became more important particularly for the most persistent compound, PCB-153. These results suggest that variation in bioaccumulation assessment is reduced most by improved identification of food sources as well as by accounting for the chemical bioavailability in food components. Improvements in the accuracy of aqueous exposure appear to be less relevant when applied to moderate to highly hydrophobic compounds, because this route contributes only marginally to total uptake. The determination of chemical bioavailability and the increase in understanding and qualifying the role of sediment components (black carbon, labile organic matter, and the like) on chemical absorption efficiencies has been identified as a key next steps.","Explaining differences between bioaccumulation measurements in laboratory and field data through use of a probabilistic modeling approach","In the regulatory context, bioaccumulation assessment is often hampered by substantial data uncertainty as well as by the poorly understood differences often observed between results from laboratory and field bioaccumulation studies.

Impacts of competition were measured using the larval developmental rate and survival of larvae, adult mortality, wing length, and sex ratio. We found that intraspecific competition acted strongest against Ae. japonicus versus the other three resident mosquito species by delaying larval development and increasing adult mortality. Interspecific competition was generally weak and significant main effects were only detected for species and density. Overall, our results show that larval competition between Ae. japonicus and the three resident species was weak when present, indicating that other ecological or behavioral factors may be influencing the invasion success for Ae. japonicus in North America.","Weak larval competition between the invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus Diptera Culicidae and three resident container-inhabiting mosquitoes in the laboratory","The spread of exotic mosquito species into new environments can introduce shifts in mosquito populations and potentially alter public health risks to mosquito-borne diseases.

In order to detect the percentage of parasitism by T. agriope and Psix sp. on the eggs of Brachynema signatum, Acrosternum heegeri, Croantha ornatula and Graphosoma lineatum, parasitic eggs were collected from nature. Then, for detection of daily parasitism, 100 eggs of different host bugs for 24 hours, were offered to one of each egg parasitoid species. In order to detect the host preference, 50 eggs of each wasp species for 24 hours, were offered to one of the each parasitoid. For detection of the male copulation capability, first male emergences of each egg parasitoids wasp were exposed to 30 female and then this female released on the one newly egg mass.

As part of the development and standardization of a laboratory bioaccumulation method for the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus, mayfly nymph Hexagenia spp., and juvenile fathead minnow Pimephales promelas were exposed to a variety of field-contaminated sediments (n=10) to evaluate their relative effectiveness for accumulating different contaminants (e.g., dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT] and metabolites, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans [PCDD/Fs], and heavy metals). Bioaccumulation was usually highest in L. variegatus but also most variable within and (relative measures) between sediments. Bioaccumulation was similar between L. variegatus and Hexagenia spp. in most of the sediments tested. Significant differences in bioaccumulation between species were observed for DDT, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), PAHs, and PCDD/Fs. The present study indicates that species-specific differences in bioaccumulation may, but do not always, exist and can vary with contaminant and sediment type.

A high level of resistance to fufenozide (320.3-fold) in Plutella xylostella (L.) has been selected under laboratory conditions. In this study, the stability and biochemical basis of resistance to fufenozide were investigated. The resistance ratio to fufezonide declined substantially from 320.3- to 20.5-fold in the fufenozide resistant strain (JSR) when the selection pressure was removed for six consecutive generations. However, the susceptibility to fufezonide could not be fully restored after 28 generations without exposure to the compound. Increased relative fitness (0.87) was associated with the rapid reversal of resistance in the resistance decaying strain (JSRD). The enzymatic analyses showed reduced specific activities of monooxygenase (MO), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), carboxylesterase and aryl-acylamidase in the JSRD strain, whereas the activity of chitinase increased. The current findings suggest the selected resistance to fufenozide in P. xylostella is not stable, and the four detoxifying enzymes including MO, GSTs, carboxylesterase, and aryl-acylamidase may be involved.

The aim of this study was to determine the optimal values of some parameters of Anopheles gambiae larval development, so as to design a standard rearing protocol of highland isolates, which would ensure the biggest fourth instars, the highest pupae productivity, the shortest duration of the larval stage and the best synchronization of pupation. The density of larvae, the size of breeding water and the quantity of food supplied were tested for their effect on larval growth. Moreover, three cheap foodstuffs were selected and tested for their capability to improve the breeding yield versus TetraMin as the standard control. The larval density was a very sensitive parameter. Its optimal value, which was found to be ~1 cm-2 surface area, yielded a daily pupation peak of 38.7% on day 8 post-oviposition, and a global pupae productivity of 78.7% over a duration range of three days. Anopheles gambiae's larval growth, survival and developmental synchronization were density-dependent, and this species responded to overcrowding by producing smaller fourth instars and fewer pupae, over elongated immature lifetime and duration range of pupae occurrence, as a consequence of intraspecific competition. While shallow breeding waters (&lt;3 cm) produced a higher number of pupae than deeper ones, no effect of the breeding habitat's absolute surface area on larval development was observed. Increasing the daily food supply improved the pupae productivity but also boosted the water pollution level (which was assessed by the biological oxygen demand (BOD) and the chemical oxygen demand (COD)) up to a limit depending on the food quality, above which a rapid increase in larval mortality was recorded. The food quality that could substitute the manufactured baby fish food was obtained with weighed mixture of 1 wheat+1 shrimp+2 fish.

The results showed that spinosad was more effective on the fourth instar larvae than buprofezin. The LC50 values for spinosad and buprofezin were 70.7 and 278.2 ppm, respectively. When spinosad was mixed with buprofezin, the percent of mortality increased; it was 85%, compared with 63.3% in spinosad and 43.3% in buprofezin treatment. This means that the biorational insecticides spinosad and buprofezin can be used in a combination and cause good results with the cotton leafworm. This result suggested that the mixture of spinosad and buprofezin was more active than spinosad or buprofezin alone in all concentrations used. The larval duration, pupal period and adult longevity were not affected by all tested treatments. The number of eggs laid per female and percent of hatchability were affected in buprofezin and spinosad buprofezin in combination treatments compared with that in control. These results suggest that the combination of lethal effects of spinosad and buprofezin might affect pest population dynamics significantly by decreasing its survival and reproduction and by delaying its development.","Impact of spinosad and buprofezin alone and in combination against the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis under laboratory conditions","Toxicity of the two biorational insecticides, spinosad and buprofezin and a mixture of the two was tested against the fourth instar larvae of the cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval). The results showed that spinosad was more effective on the fourth instar larvae than buprofezin. The LC50 values for spinosad and buprofezin were 70.7 and 278.2 ppm, respectively. When spinosad was mixed with buprofezin, the percent of mortality increased; it was 85%, compared with 63.3% in spinosad and 43.3% in buprofezin treatment. This means that the biorational insecticides spinosad and buprofezin can be used in a combination and cause good results with the cotton leafworm. This result suggested that the mixture of spinosad and buprofezin was more active than spinosad or buprofezin alone in all concentrations used.

In conjunction with the outbreak, we observed an unprecedented spike in the number of sera submitted for DV antibody testing between June and December 2010, with a concomitant increase in the number of IgM-positive specimens, indicative of acute DV infection. Analysis of the place of residence of the IgM-positive patients identified from June to December of 2010 revealed that 58.1% were residents of Caribbean islands (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), whereas 40.6% were residents of the U.S. mainland or Hawaii. The U.S. residents represented 42 states plus the District of Columbia, but most (53%) were from just 3 states (California, Florida, and New York). In comparison to the Caribbean IgM-positive patient group, the U.S. IgM-positive patient group contained proportionately more adults 21 to 60 years old and fewer individuals&lt;21 years old. These findings indicate that the 2010 Caribbean DV outbreak affected many U.S. residents (mostly adults, presumably travelers) from diverse geographic areas and emphasize the potential for a viremic DV-infected returning traveler to spark a local DV outbreak by introducing DV into a community with competent mosquito vectors.","Dengue virus immunoglobulin M detection in a reference laboratory setting during the 2010 dengue virus outbreak on Caribbean islands","A large outbreak of dengue virus (DV) infections occurred on Caribbean islands during 2010, with cases peaking during the second half of the year.

The effects of male pupal age at irradiation and ray dose on adult male emergence, sterility level, longevity, and mating capacity were evaluated, and dose-response curves of residual fertility were calculated. Radiation tests were also performed on female pupae to observe their reproductive capacity in case of accidental release. Results confirmed that the age at which the male pupa is irradiated is an important factor that affects the longevity of the adult, whereas the effect of age on the induced sterility level is less pronounced. When male pupae older than 30 h were irradiated, the longevity of the adults was not affected by doses up to 40 Gy. The 40-Gy dose appeared sufficient to induce high level of sterility (&gt;99%) at any male pupal age for all the strains tested.

We evaluated adults of the two most prominent species, Phyllobius oblongus and Polydrusus sericeus, for longevity, foliage consumption, and egg production on several putative hosts commonly found in this ecosystem. Adult pairs were monitored in no-choice laboratory assays for the duration of their lifespans on basswood, Tilia americana, ironwood, Ostrya virginiana, sugar maple, Acer saccharum, raspberry, Rubus spp., or leatherwood, Dirca palustris. Overall, P. sericeus lived more than twice as long as P. oblongus and lived longer on all hosts. P. sericeus consumed more total leaf area than P. oblongus on basswood, ironwood, and raspberry, but P. oblongus had a higher leaf consumption rate on sugar maple. Basswood was a very good host for P. sericeus. Leatherwood was not a suitable host for either weevil species. The higher longevity and fecundity of P. sericeus than P. oblongus did not agree with that expected from population data, in that the latter species is substantially more abundant. This likely reflects P. oblongus' superior performance on sugar maple, the dominant flora in the study area. These data provide a basis for estimating the broader impacts of adult weevil feeding.","Laboratory performance of two polyphagous invasive weevils on the predominant woody plant species of a northern hardwood community","A complex of invasive weevils that consume roots as larvae and foliage as adults have become established in northern hardwood forests in North America.

In order to determine the activity and efficacy of spinosad against larvae of Culex mosquitoes, technical powder and liquid formulations of spinosad were tested against mosquito larvae under laboratory and field conditions. In the laboratory, spinosad powder was highly active against 2nd and 4th instars of Culex quinquefasciatus after 24 h of exposure. The extent of mortality increased slightly after 48 h of exposure. Second instars were slightly more susceptible than 4th instars. The liquid formulation showed somewhat higher activity (about 2) than the technical powder material at both the LC50 and LC90 levels. In field microcosm tests against natural populations of mosquitoes, the liquid formulation yielded excellent control of immature Culex spp. for 21 days at concentrations of 0.05 mg (AI)/liter and 35 days at 0.1 to 0.5 mg (AI)/liter in outdoor tubs. This formulation also yielded excellent control of natural Culex mosquitoes for 14 days or longer at 0.025 to 0.1 mg (AI)/liter in outdoor ponds.

The population quantity of the different development stages of B. germanica and their constitution ratio were investigated after breeding for different durations. Results The quantity of adult cockroaches with oothecae in the tested group reduced gradually after treatment for two months, six months and eight months. Accordingly, the quantity of male and female adult cockroaches also decreased gradually. The nymphae quantity after treatment for four months was two times the quantity after treatment for two months. However, it decreased rapidly in the sixth month, and the quantity of female adults and adults with oothecae were reduced to zero in the eighth month. The quantity of male adults and nymphae was 2 and 15, respectively.

A wax-based matrix was developed that provides the longevity needed for field use and is biodegradable. RESULTS Laboratory bioassays with the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa (Loew), confirmed the efficacy of bait stations containing avermectin, methomyl, spinosad and phloxine B. Field cage studies demonstrated that significant mortality occurred with either 1% (w/v) spinosad or 1% (w/v) methomyl bait stations versus pesticide-free bait stations. Bait stations were exposed to environmental conditions by placing them in trees at the ARS station in Miami, Florida, between tests. There was no loss in efficacy, in spite of exposure to over 360 mm of rainfall over the 56 days of the study, indicating that the bait stations could provide population suppression for at least 1-2 months when used in subtropical environments. CONCLUSION A long-lasting, female-targeted fruit fly bait station, such as the one developed herein, could provide a cost-effective option for fruit fly population suppression that would be an important tool in tephritid pest management and control. Additional studies are needed to demonstrate efficacy against wild fruit fly populations and determine deployment strategies.","Laboratory and field cage studies on female-targeted attract-and-kill bait stations for Anastrepha suspensa Diptera Tephritidae","BACKGROUND Development of attract-and-kill bait stations for pest fruit flies has been limited by the water solubility of sugar needed as a feeding stimulant and by the volatility of chemical attractants.

Their parasitic habit can alter the duration of post-embryonic development of these flies, altering the postmortem interval. In order to analyze possible alterations occurring during the immature development period of Nasonia vitripennis, this study tested different quantitative associations between female parasitoids and pupae of Chrysomya megacephala, which were defined by (a) one pupa was exposed to different numbers of female parasitoids (11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 111) and (b) different numbers of pupae were exposed to one female parasitoid (11, 21, 31, 41, 51). Analysis of variance (5% significance level) and Tukey's honestly significant difference tests were used for statistical analysis. There was a tendency of prolongation of the duration of parasitoid development, both by increasing the number of female parasitoids and by increasing the number of hosts in the associations. By increasing the number of female parasitoids per host, there is a possibility of increasing the occurrence of superparasitism, leading to competition for food source, then prolonging the duration of the immature development period. Increasing the number of hosts in the associations, females may distribute their postures among the available pupae and can cause reduction of the number of eggs per host. Since these insects are gregarious, the reduction of the number of eggs may delay the offspring development.","Durations of immature stage development period of Nasonia vitripennis Walker Hymenoptera Pteromalidae under laboratory conditions implications for forensic entomology","Some microhymenopterans are parasitoids of flies of forensic importance.

However, this may not always be the case because the herbivore may benefit from the added resource as much as, or more than the third-trophic level. In addition, the natural enemies of those in the third-trophic level may also derive improved fitness from the added resources. Both these processes will dampen trophic cascades, leading to less-effective biological control. In this study, the effect of adding different flowering plants on the longevity, egg load, aphid parasitism rates and hyperparasitism of Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera Braconidae) by its hyperparasitoid Dendrocerus aphidum Rondani (Hymenoptera Megaspilidae) were investigated, using the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Homoptera Aphididae) as the herbivore. Parasitoids exposed to buckwheat survived, on average, between four to five times as long as those in the control (water) and those in phacelia, alyssum and coriander treatments survived three to four times as long. Hyperparasitoids exposed to buckwheat survived five to six times as long as those in the control and three to five times longer with the other plants compared with the control. Almost all flower species significantly increased parasitoid and hyperparasitoid egg loads and the number of parasitised aphids and parasitised mummies compared with control. Understanding the factors influencing the dynamics of multitrophic interactions involving flowering plants, herbivores, parasitoids and hyperparasitoids is a fertile area for future research. One of the most challenging areas in contemporary ecology concerns the relative importance of different types of biodiversity mediating trophic interactions and thereby influencing the structure of communities and food webs.

Jar traps were much less effective than sticky traps, catching only half the number of cockroaches as sticky traps. A thin layer of petrolatum was a more effective barrier in jar traps to cockroach escape than powdered Olancha clay. Traps with petrolatum caught about twice as many cockroaches as traps with clay. Trapping of any of six life stages was not significantly affected by catch of any of the other stages.

The impact of Galerucella spp. on these plants, when grown in outdoor mesocosms that more closely mimics ecological host range, has not been reported. The first objective of this study was to compare the growth and seed capsule production of purple loosestrife, winged loosestrife, and swamp loosestrife, with and without exposure to Galerucella spp. With purple loosestrife, larval feeding on apical and lateral shoot buds resulted in fewer seed capsules, and reduced aboveground biomass and plant height compared to control plants. No measured plant growth or reproductive parameters were reduced as a result of beetle feeding on swamp loosestrife. Presence of Galerucella spp. on winged loosestrife resulted in a reduction of seed capsules in one of 2 yr of study. A second objective of our study was to compare the phenology of the three Lythraceae species in relation to that of Galerucella spp. In the northern United States, flowering and seed development in swamp loosestrife occurred a month later than in purple or winged loosestrife. The delayed flowering of swamp loosestrife resulted in avoidance of shoot meristem feeding damage caused by the first generation of beetles. Laboratory studies might have overestimated the host range of Galerucella spp. on swamp loosestrife with the finding of asynchronous flowering times of purple and swamp loosestrife. Our mesocosm studies confirm that previous laboratory host range testing did accurately predict the ecological host range of winged loosestrife.","Growth and phenology of three Lythraceae species in relation to feeding by Galerucella calmariensis and Galerucella pusilla predicting ecological host range from laboratory host range testing","Previous studies have characterized the development of the biological control insects, Galerucella calmariensis and Galerucella pusilla on purple loosestrife and on nontarget Lythraceae species, including two species native to Minnesota, winged loosestrife, and swamp loosestrife.

Laboratory studies might have overestimated the host range of Galerucella spp. on swamp loosestrife with the finding of asynchronous flowering times of purple and swamp loosestrife. Our mesocosm studies confirm that previous laboratory host range testing did accurately predict the ecological host range of winged loosestrife.","biological control agents and flowering and growth and host range and natural enemies and phenology and plant height and seed development and weeds and Decodon verticillatus and Galerucella and Lythrum salicaria and Decodon and Lythraceae and Myrtales and dicotyledons and angiosperms and Spermatophyta and plants and eukaryotes and Chrysomelidae and Coleoptera and insects and Hexapoda and arthropods and invertebrates and animals and Lythrum and Galerucella and anthesis and biocontrol agents and biological control organisms and Galerucella calmariensis and Galerucella pusilla and Lythrum alatum and purple loosestrife and Plant Physiology and Biochemistry (FF060) and Weeds and Noxious Plants (FF500) and Biological Control (HH100)","","JOUR","Katovich, E.

Two new rearing methods were investigated to partition larval populations within the rearing space and thus increase rearing efficiency. The 2 methods separated groups of 50 larvae into each of either six 500-ml cylindrical cups or twelve 400-ml rectangular bins, each containing approximately 450 or 400 ml of water, respectively, and occupying approximately the same amount of shelf space as the 2542 cm pans. The cup and bin protocols multiplied rearing potential by 2 and 4, respectively, under the same space constraints. A preliminary experiment was conducted to compare larval development and adult body size (using wing length as a surrogate) of mosquitoes reared in partitioned containers with those reared in the traditional open pan method.

Since the first report of L. humile in California in 1907 its range expanded statewide, displacing native ant species wherever it spread. Since the discovery of established populations of S. invicta in southern California in 1998, it has been restricted to discrete areas of southern California. However, as these discrete populations expand, they are encountering large populations of L. humile, which are effective competitors for available resources and are particularly aggressive in their encounters with other ant species such as S. invicta. Most Dolichoderine ants such as L. humile do not prefer to forage on baits made with defatted corn grit and soybean oil typically used in red imported fire ant control programs. Applications of these baits in areas where distributions of these species overlap might selectively affect populations of S. invicta and give L. humile a competitive advantage. Three laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the competitive outcomes between S. invicta pitted against L. humile (1) agonistic behavior of workers in small arenas, (2) colony interactions with different population ratios, and (3) the effects of pyriproxyfen on the competitiveness of S. invicta against L. humile. Populations of S. invicta consisting of major workers killed more L. humile than did minors or a mixture of majors and minors. When paired against L. humile colonies consisting of 1,100 workers, colonies consisting of 38 S. invicta workers were easily defeated by L. humile. Colonies consisting of 450 S. invicta workers plugged their nest entrances, but they were ultimately defeated by L. humile after 13 d. The S. invicta colonies consisting of 1,100 workers took control of the bridge connecting the colonies, invaded the L. humile colony, killed the Argentine ant queens, and removed their brood. Pyriproxyfen-treated fire ant workers took significantly longer to chase the Argentine ants from a connecting bridge than did untreated fire ants. Thus, fire ant baits may have long-term effects on intercolonial aggression between S. invicta and L. humile, especially when Argentine ant populations are high in the summer.","Aggressive interactions between Solenopsis invicta and Linepithema humile Hymenoptera Formicidae under laboratory conditions","The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), and the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, are natural agonists in their country of origin.

Like all Manduca, M. sexta typically has 5 larval instars, with developmental commitment to metamorphosis occurring early in the fifth (final) instar. It was shown that M. sexta from a field population in North Carolina (USA) showed substantial intraspecific variation in the number of larval instars when feeding on a modified artificial diet. Individuals with 6 instars consistently exhibited slower growth rates during early larval development than individuals with 5 instars. The frequency of individuals with 6 instars decreased with increased rearing temperature. In contrast, M. sexta from a laboratory colony consistently had 5 instars and had more rapid larval growth rates than M. sexta from the field. A threshold body size was identified at the start of the fifth instar that predicted whether an individual will have 5 (greater than 600 mg) or 6 instars (less than 600 mg). Variation in field populations in Manduca provides an important resource for understanding physiological control, developmental plasticity and evolution of growth rate, body size and instar number.","Variation in growth and instar number in field and laboratory Manduca sexta","The tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta has been an important model system for understanding physiological control of growth, development and metamorphosis of insects for more than half a century.

The frequency of individuals with 6 instars decreased with increased rearing temperature. In contrast, M. sexta from a laboratory colony consistently had 5 instars and had more rapid larval growth rates than M. sexta from the field. A threshold body size was identified at the start of the fifth instar that predicted whether an individual will have 5 (greater than 600 mg) or 6 instars (less than 600 mg). Variation in field populations in Manduca provides an important resource for understanding physiological control, developmental plasticity and evolution of growth rate, body size and instar number.","developmental stages and evolution and genetic variation and growth and insect pests and larvae and plant pests and North Carolina and USA and insects and Manduca sexta and Hexapoda and arthropods and invertebrates and animals and eukaryotes and Manduca and Sphingidae and Lepidoptera and insects and Appalachian States of USA and Southern States of USA and USA and APEC countries and Developed Countries and North America and America and OECD Countries and South Atlantic States of USA and genetic variability and genotypic variability and genotypic variation and growth phase and pest insects and United States of America and Plant Pests (FF620) (New March 2000) and Reproduction, Development and Life Cycle (Wild Animals) (YY200) (New March 2000) and Genetics and Molecular Genetics (Wild Animals) (YY300) (New March 2000)","","JOUR","Kingsolver, J.

There is a lot of information from laboratory tests regarding the effects of chemicals on beneficial predators and parasitoids but very few translations of these effects into field impacts particularly under commercial conditions. To address this issue we calculated a chemical toxicity score for 19 commercial vineyards based on IOBC toxicity ratings and application number, and compared this to extensive field collections to determine if natural enemy populations can be related to predicted toxicity loadings. Invertebrates were sampled four times during the growing season using canopy sticky traps and ground level pitfall traps. Ordination analyses using non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated community structure in vineyards correlated to site chemical use, while principal components analyses identified the taxa involved. One ordination axis from canopy data and two axes from ground level data were correlated to overall IOBC ratings for the vineyards. Principal components analyses indicated that spiders, lacewings, carabids and parasitoids were all affected by chemical use. IOBC rating based on laboratory studies therefore correlated with chemical effects on field populations of natural enemies in commercial vineyards where complexes of pesticides were applied. The use of chemicals with low toxicity to beneficials as predicted by IOBC ratings will contribute to preservation and maintenance of natural enemies in vineyard ecosystems.","Field validation of laboratory-derived IOBC toxicity ratings for natural enemies in commercial vineyards","Management of pests and diseases remains a key issue for agricultural profitability and environmental health.

These four indexes varied between the colonies; two of them (the survival rate of workers and the wood consumption rate) changed with changes in the intensity of the gamma irradiation.

Using laboratory y-olfactometers, we studied the attraction of four different Ae. aegypti populations (North Queensland, Australia; Florida, USA; Singapore; and Minas Gerais, Brazil) to a key attractant compound from human skin, lactic acid. Combinations of lactic acid with ammonia and a fatty acid (caproic acid) were also investigated. The aims were to determine the extent of variation in lactic acid dose response among populations and to see whether all four populations responded equally to combinations of human odor components. Although all Ae. aegypti populations were attracted to lactic acid, there were differences in the threshold dose Florida 0.03 g/min, Singapore 0.17 g/min, North Queensland 1.92 g/min, and Brazil 10.27 g/min. Attraction to lactic acid alone (maximum &lt;40%) was significantly lower than for human odor (&gt;87% for all populations). Significant increases in attraction were observed when lactic acid was combined with ammonia or caproic acid, although not for all populations. In addition, the highest doses of caproic acid tested decreased attraction when combined with lactic acid.

Groups of workers and soldiers were disturbed in a central chamber and then monitored during a 5-d period to examine the percentage that initially evacuated, percentage of evacuees that returned, time to evacuate, time to return, and rates (percentage per hour) of evacuation and return between different temperatures and between soldier levels.

The results showed that the efficacy of five entomopathogenic fungi, i.e. two isolates of Beauveria bassiana (Bb. 4591 and Bb. 5335), two isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae (Ma. 6079 and Ma. 7965) as well as one isolate of Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Pfu. 5338) varied depending on the temperature and the fungal isolate in both thrips species. The LC50 values decreased with increasing temperature. All fungal isolates showed a significantly higher efficacy against both thrips species at 25 and 30C than at 16C. Among five isolates, B. bassiana Bb. 5335 and M. anisopliae Ma. 7965 were superior in terms of efficacy against both thrips species within a broader range of temperature.

Both thrips species reared on bean, cucumber, leek and swan river daisy (Brachycome [Brachyscome] iberidifolia) were highly susceptible to fungal infection but significantly less susceptible when reared on cotton and saintpaulia (Saintpaulia brevipilosa).","Effect of temperature and host plant on the efficacy of different entomopathogenic fungi from Thailand against Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande and Thrips tabaci Lindeman Thysanoptera Thripidae in the laboratory","The current study is focusing on the effect of temperature and host plant on the efficacy of different entomopathogenic fungi from Thailand against western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis and onion thrips, Thrips tabaci. The results showed that the efficacy of five entomopathogenic fungi, i.e. two isolates of Beauveria bassiana (Bb. 4591 and Bb. 5335), two isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae (Ma. 6079 and Ma. 7965) as well as one isolate of Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Pfu. 5338) varied depending on the temperature and the fungal isolate in both thrips species. The LC50 values decreased with increasing temperature. All fungal isolates showed a significantly higher efficacy against both thrips species at 25 and 30C than at 16C. Among five isolates, B. bassiana Bb. 5335 and M. anisopliae Ma. 7965 were superior in terms of efficacy against both thrips species within a broader range of temperature.

Spanning an area of similar to 1000 km(2) in central Amazonia, the BDFFP was initially designed to evaluate the effects of fragment area on rainforest biodiversity and ecological processes. However, over its 38-year history to date the project has far transcended its original mission, and now focuses more broadly on landscape dynamics, forest regeneration, regional- and global-change phenomena, and their potential interactions and implications for Amazonian forest conservation. The project has yielded a wealth of insights into the ecological and environmental changes in fragmented forests. For instance, many rainforest species are naturally rare and hence are either missing entirely from many fragments or so sparsely represented as to have little chance of long-term survival. Additionally, edge effects are a prominent driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage and a diversity of fauna. Even within our controlled study area, the landscape has been highly dynamic: for example, the matrix of vegetation surrounding fragments has changed markedly over time, succeeding from large cattle pastures or forest clearcuts to secondary regrowth forest. This, in turn, has influenced the dynamics of plant and animal communities and their trajectories of change over time. In general, fauna and flora have responded differently to fragmentation: the most locally extinction-prone animal species are those that have both large area requirements and low tolerance of the modified habitats surrounding fragments, whereas the most vulnerable plants are those that respond poorly to edge effects or chronic forest disturbances, and that rely on vulnerable animals for seed dispersal or pollination. Relative to intact forests, most fragments are hyperdynamic, with unstable or fluctuating populations of species in response to a variety of external vicissitudes. Rare weather events such as droughts, windstorms and floods have had strong impacts on fragments and left lasting legacies of change. Both forest fragments and the intact forests in our study area appear to be influenced by larger-scale environmental drivers operating at regional or global scales. These drivers are apparently increasing forest productivity and have led to concerted, widespread increases in forest dynamics and plant growth, shifts in tree-community composition, and increases in liana (woody vine) abundance. Such large-scale drivers are likely to interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation, exacerbating its effects for some species and ecological phenomena. Hence, the impacts of fragmentation on Amazonian biodiversity and ecosystem processes appear to be a consequence not only of local site features but also of broader changes occurring at landscape, regional and even global scales.","An Amazonian rainforest and its fragments as a laboratory of global change","We synthesize findings from one of the world's largest and longest-running experimental investigations, the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP).

However, there have been few studies that examine potential effects of biochar on insect communities. We examined the direct effects of one formulation of dry biochar on survival of four species of common forest insects: major adult workers of the thatch ants, Formica obscuripes Forel (Hymenoptera: Formicidae); adult bark beetles, Ips pini (Say) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) and adults of two bark beetle predators, Temnochila chlorodia (Mannerheim) (Coleoptera: Trogossitidae) and Enoclerus sphegeus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Cleridae). There was a significant reduction in survival for three of the four species (F. obscuripes, I. pini and T. chlorodia) when exposed to dry biochar in confined arenas. The decreased survival only occurred when the insects had direct contact with the material. Further, while exposure to all particle sizes significantly decreased survival, the decreased survival was not different among the particle sizes tested (< 150 mm, > 1.0 mm, or a combination of particle sizes). The results demonstrate a potential for negative impacts on multiple insect species following exposure to dry biochar.

To integrate these advances, virtual laboratories offer a unique tool to facilitate, expedite, and accelerate research into the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. We introduce the uniquely cloud-based Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory (BCCVL), which provides access to numerous species distribution modelling tools; a large and growing collection of biological, climate, and other environmental datasets, as well as a variety of experiment types to conduct research into the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Users can upload and share datasets, potentially increasing collaboration and cross-fertilisation of ideas and innovation among the user community. Feedback confirms that the BCCVL's goals of lowering the technical requirements for species distribution modelling, and reducing time spent on such research, are being met. We present a case study that illustrates the utility of the BCCVL as a research tool that can be applied to the problem of vector borne diseases and the likelihood of climate change altering their future distribution across Australia. This case study presents the preliminary results of an ensemble modelling experiment which employs multiple (15) different species distribution modelling algorithms to model the distribution of one of the main mosquito vectors of the most common vector borne disease in Australia: Ross River Virus (RRV). We use the BCCVL to do future projection of these models with future climates based on two extreme emissions scenarios, for multiple years. Our results show a large range in both the modelled current distribution, and projected future distribution, of the mosquito species studied. Most models (that were built using different algorithms) show somewhat similar current distributions of the species however there are three models that are obvious outliers. The projected models show a similar range in the distribution of the species, with some models indicating a fewer areas (and also areas with a lower probability of occurrence in specific areas) where the species is likely to be found under a climate change scenario. However, a majority of models show an expanded distribution, with some areas that have a greater probability of the occurrence of this species; this will provide a more robust indication of future distribution for policy makers and planners, than if just one or a few models had been employed. The economic and human health impact of vector borne diseases underline the importance of scientifically sound projections of the future spread of common disease vectors such as mosquitos under various climate change scenarios. This is because such information is essential for policy-makers to identify vulnerable communities and to better manage outbreaks and potential epidemics of such diseases. The BCCVL has provided the means to effectively and robustly bracket multiple sources of uncertainty in the future spread of RRV: this study focuses on two of these - the future distribution of a primary mosquito vector of the disease under two extreme scenarios of climate change. Research is underway to expand our analysis to take into account more sources of uncertainty: more vector and amplifying host species, emissions scenarios, and future climate projections from a range of different global climate models.","The Biodiversity and Climate Change Virtual Laboratory How Ecology and Big Data can be utilised in the fight against vector-borne diseases","Advances in computing power and infrastructure, increases in the number and size of ecological and environmental datasets, and the number and type of data collection methods, are revolutionizing the field of Ecology.

In the past, poor survival in the laboratory has precluded controlled long-term studies on Bythotrephes. Here we investigated field collection techniques and choices of culture media, temperature, and diet that led to the successful maintenance of Bythotrephes from birth to reproduction. Gravid parthenogenic females were collected from invaded lakes. Resulting offspring were reared in source lake water filtered through 20 or 80 mu m, or a fully defined artificial culture medium, FLAMES. Individuals raised in FLAMES produced significantly larger broods than those in lake water, indicating that it is an appropriate culture medium. We next conducted a 96-h temperature bioassay on juvenile Bythotrephes. Survival was comparable at 16 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 24 degrees C but decreased after 48 h at 28 degrees C, and most animals died after 24 h at 32 degrees C. We also reared Bythotrephes at 16 degrees C, 19 degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 25 degrees C. Corresponding intrinsic rates of natural increase (r) for animals maintained to first brood release were 0.02, 0.05, 0.06, and 0.03 d(-1), suggesting that Bythotrephes should be reared at similar to 22 degrees C to benefit from maximum population increases. Feeding trials confirmed that young Bythotrephes prefer small, slow-moving prey. Finally, we devised a protocol for rearing Bythotrephes that yielded 100% survival to reproduction and r = 0.10 d(-1) (for animals maintained to first brood release). Given these results, it is now possible to conduct long-term laboratory studies on this invader.","Methods for rearing the invasive zooplankter Bythotrephes in the laboratory","The invasive spiny water flea's (Bythotrephes longimanus) current North American distribution encompasses the Laurentian Great Lakes as well as a number of inland lakes, particularly on the Canadian Shield. In the past, poor survival in the laboratory has precluded controlled long-term studies on Bythotrephes. Here we investigated field collection techniques and choices of culture media, temperature, and diet that led to the successful maintenance of Bythotrephes from birth to reproduction. Gravid parthenogenic females were collected from invaded lakes. Resulting offspring were reared in source lake water filtered through 20 or 80 mu m, or a fully defined artificial culture medium, FLAMES. Individuals raised in FLAMES produced significantly larger broods than those in lake water, indicating that it is an appropriate culture medium. We next conducted a 96-h temperature bioassay on juvenile Bythotrephes. Survival was comparable at 16 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 24 degrees C but decreased after 48 h at 28 degrees C, and most animals died after 24 h at 32 degrees C. We also reared Bythotrephes at 16 degrees C, 19 degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 25 degrees C. Corresponding intrinsic rates of natural increase (r) for animals maintained to first brood release were 0.02, 0.05, 0.06, and 0.03 d(-1), suggesting that Bythotrephes should be reared at similar to 22 degrees C to benefit from maximum population increases. Feeding trials confirmed that young Bythotrephes prefer small, slow-moving prey. Finally, we devised a protocol for rearing Bythotrephes that yielded 100% survival to reproduction and r = 0.10 d(-1) (for animals maintained to first brood release).

In this study, we evaluated the life history and demographic parameters of P. pallidus fragariae on three cultivars (Selva, Camarosa and Queen Elisa) of strawberry. The experiment was conducted at a constant temperature of 20 +/- 1 degrees C, 80 +/- 10% RH and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) hours. The age-stage, two-sex life table program was used to analyze the data. The development time was faster on Selva than on Queen Elisa (18.8 vs. 19.1 days). The oviposition period was longer on Queen Elisa than on Camarosa (12.5 vs. 11.9 days). Fecundity and female adult longevity of P. pallidus fragariae were not significantly different among the three cultivars of strawberry. Life table provides the most comprehensive description of the survival, stage differentiation and reproduction of the population. Although some variations observed in the life table parameters of P. pallidus fragariae, no significant differences were observed among three different cultivars. The fast growth was observed for P. pallidus fragariae on Queen Elisa based on population projection. Therefore, research on these three strawberry cultivars can be used to improve our understanding of the population dynamics of the pest and thereby developing effective pest management programs against P. pallidus fragariae.","Comparison of the life table and reproduction parameters of the Phytonemus pallidus fragariae on the three strawberry cultivars under laboratory conditions","The strawberry mite, Phytonemus pallidus fragariae (Acari: Tarsonemidae), is an important pest of strawberries grown in a greenhouse, and field-grown strawberries also may be infested at the high humidity conditions.

A salt scaling test performed on the formed surfaces of laboratory specimens revealed mass losses slightly greater than the control but less than the specified threshold. Inspection of the field slabs showed no signs of salt scaling damage with the exception of the 50% slag mixture, which is experiencing light scaling after 2 years.

From these data, four aspects of parasite population dynamics were analyzed quantitatively: 1) successive losses in abundance as parasites developed from gametocyte to ookinete to oocyst stages, 2) oocyst production of sporozoites, 3) correlation between various lifestage parameters, and 4) parasite distribution. Parasite populations in A. gambiae incurred a 316-fold loss in abundance during the transition from macrogametocyte to ookinete stage, a 100-fold loss from ookinete to oocyst stage, yielding a total loss of approximately 31,600-fold (i.e., losses are multiplicative). Comparative susceptibilities in order were A, freeborni much greater than A. gambiae, A. arabiensis, A. dirus > A. stephensi, A. albimanus. The key transition(s) determining overall susceptibility differed among species. Despite species differences in oocyst densities and infection rates, salivary gland sporozoite production per oocyst (approximately 640) was the same among species. The most consistent association among lifestage parameters was a positive correlation between densities and infection rates of homologous lifestages.

We analysed the effect of several variables on the morphology of the rotifer Keratella tropica with the aim of accounting for its morphological variability in nature. We used field data from (i) an extensive survey of Argentine lakes, (ii) a 1. 5 yr, monthly sampling of Salto Grande Reservoir, and (iii) a 3-month, outdoor experiment in fish culture tanks. In addition, we performed a series of laboratory experiments aimed at isolating the effects of different variables. 2. The increase in crustacean biomass and the amelioration of their nutritional status (measured as the reciprocal of the starvation time) caused spine enlargement. In contrast, the presence of decomposers caused reduction of the spines. These results support the idea that a major proportion of the phenotypic expression of K. tropica depends on the concentration of an inducing factor, which in turn depends on the balance between release and decomposition rates of the chemical. 3. Food concentration was identified as a secondary factor affecting morphology. In agreement with records for other rotifers, food concentration and spine length were inversely related. Both factors, crustacean chemicals and food availability, seemed to act independently, at different developmental stages. Our experiments suggest, however, that the most exuberant individuals can only be induced through chemicals released by predators and competitors. 4. The presence of backswimmers (Notonectidae) resulted in individuals with very short or non-existing posterior spines. Filtrates of backswimmer-conditioned medium also produced a significant, although less striking, spine inhibition. Thus, different chemical factors seem to have opposite effects on K. tropica morphology. Those released by crustaceans induce spine elongation, while those released by backswimmers inhibit spine development. 5. Genetic differences were also identified as a source of morphological variability. Under identical laboratory conditions, different clones had spines of different length. Our experiments also suggest an inverse relationship between spine length and growth rate. The latter result, however, is based upon only three clones of K. tropica and is thus preliminary.","INDUCTION AND INHIBITION OF SPINE DEVELOPMENT IN THE ROTIFER KERATELLA-TROPICA - EVIDENCE FROM FIELD OBSERVATIONS AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS","1.

The paper describes the development of a computer model designed to simulate the aphid's population dynamics on saplings in the controlled environment of the laboratory, i.e. in the absence of natural enemies. The model was able to account for about 80% of the variation in aphid numbers within and between trees over a three month period. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the number of pine aphids is limited primarily by nymphal emigration, the operation of which is sensitive both to density and to plant quality as reflected in aphid growth rates. Of secondary importance are changes in reproduction acting through increased reproductive delay, again a result of altered growth rates and adult size. Development, too, has an important secondary influence. Contrary to expectation and conventional belief, however, alate production proved to be of negligible importance, either in limiting or regulating population numbers. Alatae are produced in too few numbers and for too short a period to significantly alter the pattern of population change.","THE POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF THE LARGE PINE APHID CINARA-PINEA MORDV 1 SIMULATION OF LABORATORY POPULATIONS","The large pine aphid, Cinara pinea lives exclusively on Pinus species, where it feeds on the foliated shoots of the current and previous year.

Sensitivity analysis revealed that the number of pine aphids is limited primarily by nymphal emigration, the operation of which is sensitive both to density and to plant quality as reflected in aphid growth rates. Of secondary importance are changes in reproduction acting through increased reproductive delay, again a result of altered growth rates and adult size. Development, too, has an important secondary influence. Contrary to expectation and conventional belief, however, alate production proved to be of negligible importance, either in limiting or regulating population numbers. Alatae are produced in too few numbers and for too short a period to significantly alter the pattern of population change.","","","Article","KIDD, NAC","","RESEARCHES ON POPULATION ECOLOGY","1990","32","2","189","208","10.1007/BF02512557","English","WoS_Core_Collections"

The effect of temperature on the development and survival of this species was determined at five constant temperatures (20, 25, 30, 32.5 and 35 degrees C) in the laboratory. Results showed a temperature dependent development of T. castaneum. Data were fitted to the nonlinear Briere model, which for the total immature period estimated the lower threshold at 20.2 degrees C, the upper developmental threshold at 35.3 degrees C, and the temperature for maximum developmental rate at 31.2 degrees C. The Ikemoto and Takai linear model indicated that 659.7 degree-days above a threshold of 16.9 degrees C were needed to complete immature development from egg to adult emergence. Survival of immature stages varied significantly across temperatures and was well described by an extreme-value function. The model indicated that the highest survival (73.0%) was estimated to occur at 27.4 degrees C. The curve shows a skewed bell shape, indicating that survival decreases at both ends of the temperature range.

An assessment of the toxicity of pesticides to predators is a necessary component of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies. In order to evaluate the risks of field insecticide application, we studied the influence of chlorantraniliprole on C. septempunctata larvae using different exposure doses. Chlorantraniliprole exhibited low contact toxicity against 2nd instar larvae of C. septempuncta ta with the LR 50 was 482.7063 g a.i. ha1 by after a 72-h exposure. In a long-term test, the LR 50 of chlorantraniliprole for C. septempunctata decreased from 88.97 to 58.22 g a.i. ha1, while the hazard quotient (HQ) values were below the threshold value of 2 during the entire observation period. This indicated a low toxicity risk from insecticide exposure. The total effect (E) suggested that chlorantraniliprole could be classified as harmless/slightly harmful to C. septempunctata below/at 200% of the MRFR (the manufacturer maximum recommended field rate) of 120 g a.i. ha1. We also determined no observed effect application rates (NOERs) of chlorantraniliprole on survival (7.5 g a.i. ha1), developmental time (15 g a.i. ha1) and fecundity (30 g a.i. ha1). Chlorantraniliprole significantly reduced the pupation rate, adult emergence, egg hatchability, and predation success. Population parameters, including R 0 , r , , and T were significantly affected when C. septempunctata were treated with chlorantraniliprole at higher label rates. These results demonstrated that the use of chlorantraniliprole may reduce C. septempunctata population levels and the level of biological control provided by this species.

In this thesis, the possibility to reconstruct the crime scene and the decomposition process was investigated. In addition, a 3D model aiming to integrate the biological and thanatological information was generated. The possibility of utilising Autodesk 123D Catch software as a new tool for 3D reconstruction of a crime scene was thoroughly evaluated. First experiments demonstrated that the number of photos required to obtain the best result was specified to be from 20 to 30 photos as a minimum. In addition, significant experiments were performed in different conditions of sizes, locations, and different involved materials. The measurements were obtained from the models using the same software were compared with the real measurements of the tested objects. The result of the correlation between real and estimated measurements showed a very strong agreement ranging from 0.994 to 1.000. With reference to the documentation of the decomposition process, there are different factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, have been reported affecting the decomposition of a carrion/body. These factors mainly interact with the rates of the biological and chemical reaction happening after death. The biological reactions are mainly due to the activity of microorganism and insects. Pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) were used as a model for human studies and the results obtained have been applied to other mammals without considering the effect of fur on the decomposition process and on the insect and microbial colonisation. In order to investigate this point, rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) with and without fur were used in two sets of experiments at Huddersfield in summer 2014 and in spring 2015. The results obtained in this study showed a similarity of the decomposition stages between animals with and without fur. However, the decomposition process was faster during the summer due to the fast of insect colonisation and activity. In addition, the entomological data collected during the summer and spring experiments were demonstrated that the same taxa nearly were present in both seasons, except Hydrotaea (Diptera, Muscidae), which was presented only in the summer experiment, moreover, only one sample of Lucilia sericata (Calliphoridae) was detected in the spring season. Differences in colonisation time were observed only in spring experiment; animals without fur were colonised two days before animals with fur. The season could have affected the insects activity and the spread of the decomposition volatiles. The microbial communities during the decomposition process were investigated using BIOLOG EcoPlateTM and the hypervariable V1-3 region of 16S rRNA gene was used for their molecular identification based on pyrosequencing. Eurofins Genomic Operon using 454-GS Junior pyrosequencing platform (Roche) carried out these analyses. The functional diversity of the bacterial communities on all carcasses samples showed a considerable variability depending on the stage of the decomposition and the sampling region (Oral cavity, skin and interface-sand-carrion) in both seasons. Furthermore, over the molecular analyses of bacterial communities at the phylum level, four main phyla of bacteria were detected among analysed carrion during the decomposition process. These phyla were changed significantly during the stages of the decomposition and between sampling regions. While no difference was observed due to presence or absence of fur. On the other hand, the analysis at the family level was able to highlight differences at the temporal scale but as well as carrion with and without fur. The statistical analysis results showed a significant difference in the bacterial community family distribution among the presence of fur and among the decomposition stages, with significant differences among sampling regions and seasons.","Documentation of the body transformations during the decomposition process from the crime scene to the laboratory","Forensic science is defined as the application of scientific or technical practices to the recognition, collection, analysis, and interpretation of evidence for criminal and civil law or regulatory issues.

"317093",317093,"Friberg_2012","Macroparasites, immune responses and immunoregulation in wild and laboratory murids This thesis primarily addresses environmental influences, in particular exposure to macroparasite infection, on immunoregulatory expression in wild and laboratory murid rodents. Experimental studies in laboratory mice demonstrated that Heligmosomoides bakeri infection was generally associated with upregulation of systemic toll-like receptor (TLR) expression and TLR-mediated cytokine production at times of peak standing worm burden. TLR function and patterns of expression of TLR and other immunoregulatory genes were also monitored in a time series of wild mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) from a natural population exposed to a range of macroparasites, including Heligmosomoides polygyrus. Differences between wild and laboratory mice in the pattern of coexpression of immunoregulatory and TLR genes and in the transcriptional responses of immunoregulatory genes to TLR-stimulation suggested a stronger regulatory bias in the wild compared to laboratory mice. Perhaps most strikingly, wild mice constitutively express relatively very much more TGF-Bl, TLR2 and TLR4, but not other immunoregulatory genes such as FoxP3, IL-l0 or TNF-a. This indicates that immunoregulatory differences between wild and laboratory mice may be linked to differences in TGF-B1 producing cells, rather than IL-10-producing or FoxP3+ cells. Immunoepidemiological analyses indicated a substantial association of macroparasitic infection (principally due to the louse Polyplax serrata and Heligmosomoides polygyrus) with TLR-mediated cytokine responsiveness in wild mice. Given the primary role of TLRs in anti-bacterial responses, the consistent experimental and epidemiological links between macroparasites and TLRs in this study are interpreted as a possible effect of exposure of the host to bacteria co-localizing in macroparasite infection foci. The identity of genes differentially upregulated in wild vs. laboratory mice might also relate to bacterial exposures (possibly influenced by macroparasite infection, given the associations with TLRs described above?). Thus, TLR2 and TLR4 are key innate anti- bacterial receptors and TGF-B1 is prominently secreted by Th3-type T-regulatory cells which are associated with mucosal tolerance.","Macroparasites immune responses and immunoregulation in wild and laboratory murids","This thesis primarily addresses environmental influences, in particular exposure to macroparasite infection, on immunoregulatory expression in wild and laboratory murid rodents. Experimental studies in laboratory mice demonstrated that Heligmosomoides bakeri infection was generally associated with upregulation of systemic toll-like receptor (TLR) expression and TLR-mediated cytokine production at times of peak standing worm burden. TLR function and patterns of expression of TLR and other immunoregulatory genes were also monitored in a time series of wild mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) from a natural population exposed to a range of macroparasites, including Heligmosomoides polygyrus. Differences between wild and laboratory mice in the pattern of coexpression of immunoregulatory and TLR genes and in the transcriptional responses of immunoregulatory genes to TLR-stimulation suggested a stronger regulatory bias in the wild compared to laboratory mice. Perhaps most strikingly, wild mice constitutively express relatively very much more TGF-Bl, TLR2 and TLR4, but not other immunoregulatory genes such as FoxP3, IL-l0 or TNF-a. This indicates that immunoregulatory differences between wild and laboratory mice may be linked to differences in TGF-B1 producing cells, rather than IL-10-producing or FoxP3+ cells. Immunoepidemiological analyses indicated a substantial association of macroparasitic infection (principally due to the louse Polyplax serrata and Heligmosomoides polygyrus) with TLR-mediated cytokine responsiveness in wild mice.

"317219",317219,"Echols_2011","Use of an environmentally realistic laboratory test organism and field bioassessments to determine the potential impacts of active coal mining in the Dumps Creek subwatershed on the Clinch River, Virginia This research was divided into four objectives for assessing the impacts of coal mining on ecosystem health. The first objective was to provide an ecotoxicological assessment in the upper Clinch River using standard bioassessment techniques. Analysis of sediments and interstitial water (porewater) indicate higher concentrations of trace metals in samples from sites located above both a power plant (CRP) and Dumps Creek mining influences. The furthest sampling site located near Pounding Mill, Virginia (CR-PM) had higher concentrations of aluminum (2,250.9 mg/kg), copper (5.9 mg/kg) and iron (12,322.6 mg/kg) compared to samples collected directly below the Dumps Creek confluence (site CR-2). Similar results were obtained from bioaccumulation in-situ tests with the Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) in 2009. Aluminum (7.81 mg/kg), Fe (48.25 mg/kg) and Zn (7.69 mg/kg) were accumulated in higher concentrations at CR-PM site than CR-2. However, the site located below the CRP effluent discharges (CR-3L) on the left bank had substantially higher concentrations of Al (14.19 mg/kg), Cu (6.78 mg/kg), Fe (88.78 mg/kg) and Zn (7.75 mg/kg) than both CR-PM and samples collected directly opposite of this site at CR-3R.To further understand the potential impact active mining on the Clinch River, a more comprehensive ecotoxicological evaluation was conducting in the Dumps Creek subwatershed. Field bioassessments determined that biological impairment occurred directly below a deep mine discharge (CBP 001), which was characterized by a distinct hydrogen sulfide odor. Total abundance and richness of benthic macroinvertebrates decreased to 3.5-20 and 1.25-2.3, respectively at DC-1 Dn. The discharge also caused the proliferation of a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, Thiothrix nivea. During continuous discharge of the effluent, the bacteria was observed coating all surfaces at DC-1 Dn and may also contribute to an Fe-encrusted biofilm observed on in-situ clams at downstream site, DC-2 Dn. Toxicity tests with mining effluents indicate some potential toxicity of the 001 discharge, but this was variable between test organisms.Selecting the most appropriate test species for sediment and water column assays has been a primary goal for ecotoxicologists. Standard test organisms and established test guidelines exist, but US EPA recommended species may not be the most sensitive organisms to anthropogenic inputs. Therefore, Chapter Three and Four addressed the use of mayflies in routine laboratory testing. Preliminary results of toxicity tests with the mayfly, Isonychia sp. (Ephemeroptera) suggested that Isonychia were moderately sensitive to NaCl after 96-hr with an average LC50 value of 3.10 g NaCl/L. When exposed to a coal-mine processed effluent, Isonychia generated LC50 values that ranged from 13 to 39% effluent and were more sensitive to the effluent than Ceriodaphnia dubia. Based on results of the feasibility study in presented in Chapter Four, field collected organisms appear to be too unpredictable in test responses and therefore, such tests would be unreliable as stand-alone indicators of effluent toxicity.","Use of an environmentally realistic laboratory test organism and field bioassessments to determine the potential impacts of active coal mining in the Dumps Creek subwatershed on the Clinch River Virginia","This research was divided into four objectives for assessing the impacts of coal mining on ecosystem health.

"317841",317841,"Pando_2003","A Laboratory and Field Study of Composite Piles for Bridge Substructures Typically, foundation piles are made of materials such as steel, concrete, and timber.Problems associated with use of these traditional pile materials in harsh marineenvironments include steel corrosion, concrete deterioration, and marine borer attack ontimber piles. It has been estimated that the U.S. spends over $1 billion annually in repairand replacement of waterfront piling systems. Such high repair and replacement costshave led several North American highway agencies and researchers to investigate thefeasibility of using composite piles for load bearing applications, such as bridgesubstructures. As used here, the term composite piles refers to alternative pile typescomposed of fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs), recycled plastics, or hybrid materials.Composite piles may exhibit longer service lives and improved durability in harsh marineenvironments, thereby presenting the potential for substantially reduced total costs.Composite piles have been available in the North American market since the late 1980 s,but have not yet gained wide acceptance in civil engineering practice. Potentialdisadvantages of composite piles are high initial cost and questions about engineeringperformance. At present, the initial cost of composite piles is generally greater than theinitial cost of traditional piles. Performance questions relate to driving efficiency, axialstiffness, bending stiffness, durability, and surface friction. These questions existbecause there is not a long-term track record of composite pile use and there is a scarcityof well-documented field tests on composite piles.This research project was undertaken to investigate the engineering performance ofcomposite piles as load-bearing foundation elements, specifically in bridge supportapplications. The objectives of this research are to (1) evaluate the soil-pile interfacebehavior of five composite piles and two conventional piles, (2) evaluate the long-termdurability of concrete-filled FRP composite piles, (3) evaluate the driveability and theaxial and lateral load behavior of concrete-filled FRP composite piles, steel-reinforcedrecycled plastic composite piles, and prestressed concrete piles through field tests andanalyses, and (4) design and implement a long-term monitoring program for compositeand conventional prestressed concrete piles supporting a bridge at the Route 351 crossingof the Hampton River in Virginia. A summary of the main findings corresponding toeach of these objectives is provided below.A laboratory program of interface testing was performed using two types of sands andseven pile surfaces (five composite piles and two conventional piles). The interfacebehavior of the different pile surfaces was studied within a geotribology framework thatinvestigated the influence of surface topography, interface hardness, and particle size andshape. In general, the interface friction angles, both peak and residual, were found toincrease with increasing relative asperity height and decreasing relative asperity spacing.The interface shear tests for the three pile types tested at the Route 351 bridge showedthat, for medium dense, subrounded to rounded sand, with a mean particle size of 0.5mm, the residual interface friction angles are 27.3, 24.9, and 27.7 degrees for the FRPcomposite pile, the recycled plastic pile, and the prestressed concrete pile, respectively.Interface shear tests on these same piles using a medium dense, subangular to angularsand, with a mean particle size of 0.18 mm, resulted in residual interface friction anglesof 29.3, 28.8, and 28.0 degrees for the FRP composite pile, the recycled plastic pile, andthe prestressed concrete pile, respectively.A laboratory durability study was completed for the FRP shells of concrete-filled FRPcomposite piles. Moisture absorption at room temperature caused strength and stiffnessdegradations of up to 25% in the FRP tubes. Exposure to freeze-thaw cycles was foundto have little effect on the longitudinal tensile properties of saturated FRP tubes.Analyses were performed to investigate the impact of degradation of the FRP mechanicalproperties on the long-term structural capacity of concrete-filled FRP composite piles incompression and bending. The impact was found to be small for the axial pile capacitydue to the fact that the majority of the capacity contribution is from the concrete infill.The impact of FRP degradation was found to be more significant for the flexural capacitybecause the FRP shell provides most of the capacity contribution on the tension side ofthe pile.Full-scale field performance data was obtained for two composite pile types (concretefilledFRP composite piling and steel-reinforced recycled plastic piling), as well as forconventional prestressed concrete piles, by means of load test programs performed at twobridge construction sites the Route 351 bridge and the Route 40 bridge crossing theNottoway River in Virginia. The field testing at the two bridges showed no majordifferences in driving behavior between the composite piles and conventional prestressedconcrete piles. Pile axial capacities of the composite piles tested at the Route 351 bridgewere between 70 to 75% of the axial capacity of the prestressed concrete test pile. TheFRP and prestressed concrete piles exhibited similar axial and lateral stiffness, while thesteel-reinforced plastic pile was not as stiff. Conventional geotechnical analysisprocedures were used to predict axial pile capacity, axial load-settlement behavior, andlateral load behavior of the piles tested at the Route 351 bridge. The conventionalanalysis procedures were found to provide reasonable predictions for the composite piles,or at least to levels of accuracy similar to analyses for the prestressed concrete pile.However, additional case histories are recommended to corroborate and extend thisconclusion to other composite pile types and to different soil conditions.A long-term monitoring program for composite and conventional prestressed concretepiles supporting the Route 351 bridge was designed and implemented. The bridge is stillunder construction at the time of this report, therefore no conclusions have been drawnregarding the long-term performance of concrete-filled FRP composite piles. The longtermmonitoring will be done by the Virginia Department of Transportation.In addition to the above findings, initial cost data for the composite piles and prestressedconcrete piles used in this research were compiled. This data may be useful to assess theeconomic competitiveness of composite piles. The initial unit cost of the installedcomposite piles at the Route 40 bridge were about 77 % higher than the initial unit costfor the prestressed concrete piles. The initial unit costs for the composite piles installedat the Route 351 bridge were higher than the initial unit cost of the prestressed concretepiles by about 289% and 337% for the plastic and FRP piles, respectively.

The sex ratio, fecundity, egg laying threshold temperature, emergence threshold temperature, life stage development periods, and life stage mortalities were investigated. It was shown that the life stages were significantly dependent on temperature, whilst it was shown that there was no significant relationship between larval growth and Calluna vulgaris plants sourced from the study sites. The results of the population dynamics experiments were incorporated into a temperature driven, cohort based, and daily looped, stochastic population dynamics computer model. The temperature component of the model was derived from temperature data collected from nine moorland sites, at different altitudes, where there was shown to be a significant relationship between temperature and altitude. The population dynamics model was run for a fifty year period with a population of I million beetles at seven temperature regimes and five different altitudes. The model predicted that as daily mean temperatures rose, so there was a greater chance of increasing populations and that as altitude increases, so the chance of increasing populations decreases. At a predicted daily mean temperature rise of 2-3'C there was evidence of considerable population increases at lower altitudes, and with a daily mean temperature rise of 4-6'C the beetle population exhibited persistent, large, fluctuating populations in the region of three to sixty fold increases at all modelled altitudes over a number of years.

Current P. rosae control relies heavily upon the use of chemical insecticides, but these are inadequate. The aims of this study were to investigate the chemical ecology of P. rosae, particularly with regard to long range attractant and repellent semiochemicals suitable for incorporation into integrated pest management strategies; the incorporation of attractant host plant extracts, or semiochemical attractants, into the monitoring programme; and the development of an autodissemination trap for release of the pathogenic fungus Entomophthora schizophorae in the field for biological control. A number of techniques for the extraction of volatile semiochemicals from a wide range of host and non-host plant species, and P. rosae adults themselves, were employed and compared. Samples were analysed by gas chromatography (GC), and the biologically active components in these complex natural product extracts were located by coupled GC-electrophysiological techniques and identified by coupled GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Responses to the electrophysiologically active compounds were compared using electroantennographic (EAG) analysis one unusually high EAG response was observed to a toxic component in hemlock (Conium maculatum) leaf extract (y-coniceine).

Because suppression of insect transmitted plant diseases relies on sensible insect vector management, the life table parameters of B. cockerelli reared on tomato under both laboratory and field conditions in southern Texas were determined and the population dynamics were estimated according to the life table results. Generally, B. cockerelli reared on tomato in the laboratory had greater survival, fecundity, and longevity than those reared on tomato in the field, and the intrinsic mortality was the primary factor contributing to population decrease. In contrast, up to 74.2% of B. cockerelli were missing in the field. B. cockerelli reared under field conditions had a longer developmental time, shorter preoviposition and oviposition periods, shorter adult longevity, lower fecundity and higher mortality than those reared under laboratory conditions. Therefore, the intrinsic rate of increase (r<sub>m</sub>), finite rate of increase (), and net reproductive rate (R<sub>0</sub>) of field-reared B. cockerelli in south Texas were lower than the laboratory reared. These results could help in the understanding of B. cockerelli population dynamics under natural conditions in tomato fields, as well as suggest possible biotic and abiotic mortality factors that may contribute to sound insect vector management, and a better understanding of the epidemiology of B. cockerelli related diseases of tomato in south Texas and elsewhere.

Field and laboratory studies of temperature effects on calling song production and recognition in Gryllus firmus. Temperature effects on calling song production and recognition were investigated in the North American field cricket, Gryllus firmus. Temporal parameters of field-recorded G. firmus calling song are strongly affected by temperature. Chirp rate and syllable rate increase, by factors of 4 and 2, respectively, as linear functions of temperature over the range in which these animals sing in the field (12.degree. - 30.degree. C). Temperature affects syllable duration to a lesser extent, and does not influence calling song carrier frequency. Female phonotactic preference, measured on a spherical treadmill in the laboratory, also changes with temperature such that warmer females prefer songs with faster chirp and syllable rates. Best phonotaxis, measured as accuracy of orientation to the sound source, and highest walking velocity, occur in response to temperature-matched songs at 15.degree., 21.degree. and 30.degree. C. Experiments under semi-natural conditions in an outdoor arena revealed that females perform phonotaxis at temperatures as low as 13.degree. C. Taken together, the song and phonotaxis data demonstrate that this communication system is temperature coupled. A strategy is outlined by which temperatue coupling may be exploited to test hypotheses about the organization of neural networks subserving song recognition.","Temperature coupling in cricket acoustic communication 1 Field and laboratory studies of temperature effects on calling song production and recognition in Gryllus firmus","Temperature effects on calling song production and recognition were investigated in the North American field cricket, Gryllus firmus.

Changes occurred in the conditions required for the induction of diapause in breeding lines of Ephestia elutella held under constant (25.degree.C, 15 h light-9 h dark) in the laboratory or under natural conditions in an outbuilding over a 12-year period. The laboratory-reared stock recovered the capacity to diapause at 25.degree.C under short photoperiods within 10 years of transfer to the outbuilding. The stock permanently reared in the outbuilding with access to natural daylight over the same period developed the ability to avoid diapause when reared in long photoperiods at 20.degree.C. Both stocks displayed a slight decrease in the duration of the critical photoperiod as temperature was raised from 20 to 25.degree.C. Whereas both lines reared in the outbuilding became closely similar in their requirements for the initiation of diapause, differences in the most effective conditions for termination of the dormancy disappeared more gradually. A difference remained in the optimal temperature for diapause development when larvae were induced to diapause at 20.degree.C after 12 years of rearing together. Survival during diapause of the line transferred from the laboratory was generally rather lower than the resident outbuilding line, especially when larvae were reared at 25.degree.C and then exposed at a lower temperature.

Three to four day-old females with an absence or low presence of 1-3 day-old males responded very little to a host whereas in those mixed with a high density of males, the females did not feed at all, suggesting that young males were inhibitors to feeding success. Three to six day-old males stimulated feeding of 6-7 day-old females, and this effect was seen most at the highest density.

This paper offers new insights into the structure and carbon dynamics of an upland organo-mineral soil using a range of complementary research methods including soil micromorphology and laser sizing of water-stable aggregates to quantify the development of aggregates and pore space and the spatial location of carbon additions. Examination of soil thin sections revealed that the organic horizons and uppermost organo-mineral horizon are dominated by excrement from meso- and macrofauna, a finding which highlights the importance of soil fauna in reprocessing organic material. Much of this excrement had fused into undifferentiable forms, but some could be associated specifically with enchytraeids and earthworms. The specific objective of the study was to determine the extent to which alterations in soil faunal diversity and activity result in changes to the soil structure. This was done through a series of experiments at different scales in which faunal communities were manipulated by liming to increase soil pH, additions of nitrogen to increase faunal activity and additions of fauna of different sizes. Induced changes in soil fauna did not produce marked and immediate responses in either void space or water-stable aggregation; changes induced by liming and additions of fauna were small and often statistically not significant. When the location of newly photosynthesised C was traced using pulse labelling with 13CO2 it was found that there was a nucleated distribution with low concentrations of new C found in between 0 and 40% of aggregates derived from faunal excrement. Bacterial numbers on excrement were also not consistently high, although some excrement was colonised more densely, probably a result of more recent formation. This upland grassland soil is very largely the product of faunal activity over the course of its development. However, it is highly resistant to change, as current faunal activity appears to have a relatively small impact on its structure, and thus contains many elements which have functional redundancy.

Problem Statement: Psyllids as a small group of insects with plant feeding adult and nymphal stages, not only could have direct feeding damages but they could also transmit plant diseases especially viruses. Bactericera tremblayi had recently increased to high densities in onion fields in East Azarbaijan province in Iran and the pest had become widespread. This was the first study of the biology of the pest in Iran and probably in the world. Approach: After collection of the adult insects from infested onion fields, they were then reared in laboratory under controlled conditions (at 21[plus or minus]3[degree]C, 60[plus or minus]10% RH and under a 14:10 (L: D) light regime) and different life stages of the pest were studied. Results: The lifespan of adult male and female psyllids was 33.63[plus or minus]2.36 and 39.94[plus or minus]2.64 days respectively. The preoviposition period was 3.75[plus or minus]0.14 days. The total number of eggs laid per female was 625.5[plus or minus]53.9. Egg incubation took 7.44[plus or minus]0.15 days and a mean of 90.3% eggs hatched. The nymphs passed through five instars before reaching the adult stage and the development time for the nymphal stage was 17.71[plus or minus]0.61 days. The sex ratio was estimated as 1:1. Conclusions: The results of the present study could successfully be applied to future IPM strategies in order to effectively control this pest with relatively unknown biological characteristics and decrease the damages observed in onion fields.","Laboratory investigation of the biology of Bactericera tremblayi Wag Homoptera Triozidae a new pest in onion fields of Iran","Problem Statement: Psyllids as a small group of insects with plant feeding adult and nymphal stages, not only could have direct feeding damages but they could also transmit plant diseases especially viruses.

The exotic fire ants Solenopsis invicta are aggressive, destructive invaders and have a significant impact on the arthropod community of an invaded area. Unfortunately, few studies have examined the impact of fire ant-aphid mutualism on ladybird beetles, which are primarily aphid-eating predators. In addition, the mechanisms of how both the odor trail and the aggressive behavior of fire ants disturb the ladybird predation of aphids have not been studied. Our study aims to resolve these questions through laboratory experiments. The results of this study demonstrate that fire ants are strongly attracted to aphids; consequently, the association between fire ants and aphids affects the different developmental stages of ladybirds on the same host plant. In the presence of fire ants, the amount of the early instar larvae, late instar larvae, and adults of ladybirds preyed upon were reduced by 98.3%, 94.6%, and 98.2%, respectively. More seriously, the ladybird larvae rarely survived. In contrast, ladybird adults usually chose to fly away when they were attacked by fire ants. The odor trail of fire ants did not influence the ladybird larvaes' predation of aphids, whereas the aggressive behavior of the fire ants did. We observed that the mean number of aphids that was preyed upon by early instar larvae, late instar larvae, and adult ladybirds was reduced by 30.5%, 45.5%, and 63.7%, respectively in laboratory experiments. We suggest that a high population density of fire ants may 1) change the spatial-distribution patterns of insect pests and natural enemies and 2) deeply affect insect pest management in agroecosystems.","Effects of the Invasive Ant Solenopsis invicta Hymenoptera Formicidae on Menochilus sexmaculatus Coleoptera Coccinellidae as a Predators of Aphis craccivora Hemiptera Aphididae in Laboratory Conditions","The exotic fire ants Solenopsis invicta are aggressive, destructive invaders and have a significant impact on the arthropod community of an invaded area.
